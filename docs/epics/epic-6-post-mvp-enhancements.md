# Epic 6: Post-MVP Enhancements

**Epic ID:** EPIC-6
**Status:** In Progress (Stories 6.2-6.4 Done, 6.1 In Progress, 6.6 In Progress)
**Duration:** Week 5+ (ongoing)
**Dependencies:** Epic 5 (Successful Cutover)
**Risk Level:** Low (enhancements, not critical)

---

## Epic Overview

After successful production cutover, implement enhancement features that demonstrate the value of the new rule engine. These features validate that business users can now add functionality via configuration instead of code changes. This epic is OPTIONAL but demonstrates the ROI of the refactoring effort.

**Why This Epic:** Proves the business value - new features can be added via YAML configuration in minutes instead of code deployment in days.

---

## Epic Goals

1. ✅ Add example new rules from requierment.md (Korean requirements)
2. ✅ Implement Slack integration (new notification channel)
3. ✅ Add date-range filtering (new condition type)
4. ✅ Add multi-option filtering (new condition type)
5. ✅ Performance optimization if needed
6. ✅ Create rule management documentation for business users

---

## Success Criteria

- [x] Example rules from requirements working via YAML only
- [x] Slack notifications sent for configured events
- [x] Date-range rules execute correctly
- [x] Multi-option rules execute correctly
- [ ] Performance: Lambda execution <2 minutes (improved)
- [ ] Business user successfully adds rule without developer help

## Technical Context

### Example Rules from requierment.md (Korean Requirements)

**Original Korean Requirements:**
```
1. 조건, 액션을 손쉽게 추가/조합할 수 있게 구조를 변경해야 합니다.
예) a 매장 고객중 1 옵션을 선택한 사람들에게 aa포맷 문자를 전송
예) c 매장 고객중 예약시간 2시간 전 고객에게 bb포맷 문자 메세지 전송
예) 모든 매장 신규 예약 감지 시 cc 포맷 문자 메세지 전송
예) 특정 날짜 기간 내에 예약한 모든 고객 중 b 옵션을 2개이상 선택한 사람 리스트 슬랙으로 전송
```

**Translation:**
1. Easily add/combine conditions and actions
2. Example: Send "aa format" SMS to store A customers who selected option 1
3. Example: Send "bb format" SMS to store C customers 2 hours before reservation
4. Example: Send "cc format" SMS when new reservation detected (all stores)
5. Example: Send Slack list of customers who booked within specific date range AND selected 2+ b options

## Business User Rule Management Guide

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-24  
**Created for:** Business Operations Teams, Compliance, Marketing

---

### 1. Introduction

**What are rules?**

Rules are configuration-driven instructions that automatically process bookings and send notifications. Instead of waiting for developers to code new features, operations teams can now add new rules by editing `config/rules.yaml`.

**How do rules work?**

1. New booking arrives → Lambda processes it
2. System checks all enabled rules in order
3. For each rule: Does every condition match? (AND logic)
4. If yes: Execute all actions in order
5. Move to next rule

**When to add/modify rules:**

- Add new customer notification types
- Change notification timing or channels
- Create seasonal or marketing rules
- Adjust SMS template assignments
- Send alerts to operations Slack

**When to ask for developer help:**

- Need a completely new condition type (we have date_range, option matching, time windows, status codes)
- Need a new action type (we have SMS, Slack, Telegram, database updates, logging)
- YAML validation errors (developers debug syntax)
- Tests fail after your changes

---

### 2. Rule Anatomy

```yaml
rules:
  - name: "Rule Display Name"                 # Human-readable name
    description: "What this rule does"        # Purpose statement
    enabled: true                              # true = active, false = disabled
    conditions:                                # ALL must be true (AND logic)
      - type: "condition_type_1"
        params:
          param_key: "param_value"
      - type: "condition_type_2"
        params:
          param_key: "param_value"
    actions:                                   # Execute IN ORDER
      - type: "action_type_1"
        params:
          param_key: "param_value"
      - type: "action_type_2"
        params:
          param_key: "param_value"
```

**Templating in Messages:**

When writing messages in actions, use `{{ }}` brackets for substitution:

- `{{ booking.name }}` → Customer name
- `{{ booking.phone_masked }}` → Masked phone (010-****-5678)
- `{{ booking.pro_edit_count }}` → Number of edits
- `{{ booking.reserve_at }}` → Reservation datetime
- `{{ booking.status }}` → Booking status code

---

enabled: true   # Turns rule on
enabled: false  # Turns rule off (no Slack notification sent)
```

**To modify channel:**

```yaml
channel: "#your-channel-name"  # Any Slack channel your bot has access to
```

---

#### Rule: Holiday Event Customer List

**Purpose:** Collect customers with multiple options during holiday period for marketing

**Triggers:** Booking during specific date range AND customer selected 2+ options

**Delivery:** Slack notification to #marketing with customer list

```yaml
- name: "Holiday Event Customer List"
  description: "Collect multi-option customers during holidays for marketing campaigns"
  enabled: false  # Disabled by default - enable during holiday periods
  conditions:
    - type: "date_range"
      params:
        start_date: "2025-12-20"  # Start of holiday period
        end_date: "2025-12-31"    # End of holiday period
    - type: "has_multiple_options"
      params:
        keywords: ["인스타", "네이버"]  # Keywords to match (Korean)

2. Update `keywords` if needed
3. Change `enabled: false` to `enabled: true`
4. Wait for next Lambda execution (every 20 minutes)

**To disable after holiday:**

```yaml
enabled: false  # Rule stops executing immediately
```

---

### 6. Slack Template Management (Story 6.2 Integration)

#### Configuration File: `config/slack_templates.yaml`

**Purpose:** Store message templates that operations can update without code changes

**Template Anatomy:**

```yaml
template_key: |
  Line 1: {{ variable_name }}
  {% for item in items %}
  - {{ item.name }}: {{ item.value }}
  {% endfor %}
```

#### Available Variables in Templates

**Booking Object Variables:**
- `{{ booking.name }}` → Customer name
- `{{ booking.phone_masked }}` → Masked phone (010-****-5678) - **PII safe**
- `{{ booking.reserve_at }}` → Reservation date/time
- `{{ booking.pro_edit_count }}` → Number of expert corrections
- `{{ booking.status }}` → Booking status

**Critical: PII Protection**

✅ **CORRECT:** `{{ booking.phone_masked }}`
```
Result: 010-****-5678 (last 4 digits visible)
```

❌ **WRONG:** `{{ booking.phone }}`
```
Result: 01012345678 (EXPOSED - security violation)
```

**Always use `phone_masked` to protect customer privacy.**

#### Editing Slack Templates

**Step 1: Backup current templates**
```bash
cp config/slack_templates.yaml config/slack_templates.yaml.backup
```

**Step 2: Edit template in `config/slack_templates.yaml`**

Example: Modifying the expert correction message format

```yaml
expert_correction_digest: |
  보정 요청 일일 리포트:
  생성일시: {{ today_date }}
  {% for booking in bookings %}
  • {{ booking.name }} ({{ booking.phone_masked }}) - {{ booking.pro_edit_count }}건
  {% endfor %}
```

**Step 3: Test template rendering**

Run Slack integration tests to verify template renders correctly:

```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_slack_integration.py::TestSlackTemplateLoader -v
```

Expected output:
```
test_template_render_with_variables PASSED
test_template_with_jinja2_loops PASSED
test_template_pii_masking_applied PASSED
```

**Step 4: Validate end-to-end**

Enable the rule using your template and wait for next Lambda execution. Check CloudWatch logs for success.

#### Template Testing with Manual Webhook Testing

See `docs/testing/slack-integration.md` for detailed webhook testing instructions.

### 9. Monitoring and Rollback (Operational Readiness)

#### Monitoring Signals (AC 6)

**Healthy Signals:**
- Log entries for your rule name appear every 20 minutes
- Slack messages appear in the configured channel
- No error messages in logs
- Customer complaints remain stable

**Warning Signals (Monitor Closely):**
- Rule log entries but no Slack messages → Template rendering issue
- Slack channel blocked by workspace admin → Permission issue
- Same customer receiving duplicate messages → Flag logic issue

**Critical Signals (Rollback Immediately):**
- Error messages in logs with your rule name
- Customers complaining about wrong message
- SMS/Slack not being sent at all
- Database errors in CloudWatch

#### Monitoring Duration

Monitor new rules for:
- **First 1 hour:** Every 10 minutes (watch for immediate issues)
- **First 24 hours:** Every 2-4 hours (watch for edge cases)
- **First 1 week:** Daily (watch for performance/trend issues)

#### Rollback Procedures

**For minor issues (template, channel, keywords):**

1. Disable the rule immediately
   ```yaml
   - name: "Holiday Event Customer List"
     enabled: false  # Changed from true
   ```

2. Make your fix

3. Wait for next Lambda execution (20 min)

4. Monitor logs for resolution

5. Re-enable when ready

**For critical issues (revert entire rule):**

```bash
# Restore previous version
cp config/rules.yaml.backup config/rules.yaml

# Verify restoration
python scripts/print_rules.py

# Commit the revert
git add config/rules.yaml
git commit -m "Revert rule: Holiday Event Customer List due to [issue]"
```

**Ownership and Escalation (AC 6):**

| Issue Type | Owner | Escalate To | Timeline |

### 11. FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

#### Rules and Conditions

**Q: How many rules can I have?**
A: No hard limit. System evaluates all enabled rules in order. ~20-30 rules are typical.

**Q: What happens if two rules match the same booking?**
A: Both rules execute! Use `enabled: false` to prevent unwanted rules from running.

**Q: Can I test a rule without enabling it?**
A: Yes, change `enabled: false` to `enabled: true` temporarily, then change back.

**Q: What's the difference between `has_option_keyword` and `has_multiple_options`?**
A:
- `has_option_keyword`: Matches if ANY keyword is found (at least 1)
- `has_multiple_options`: Matches if MINIMUM number of keywords found (configurable)

**Q: Can I combine multiple conditions?**
A: Yes! ALL conditions must match (AND logic). No OR logic available currently.

#### Slack Integration

**Q: How do I change which channel gets Slack messages?**
A: Update the `channel` parameter in the rule's `send_slack` action:
```yaml
actions:
  - type: "send_slack"
    params:
      channel: "#your-new-channel"  # Change this
```

**Q: Can I include customer phone numbers in Slack?**
A: Never use `{{ booking.phone }}` - use `{{ booking.phone_masked }}` instead to protect privacy.

**Q: What if Slack is down?**
A: Slack failures are logged but don't stop other actions. SMS still sends.

**Q: How do I test Slack without the real webhook?**
A: Set `SLACK_ENABLED=false` to skip Slack and test other actions.

#### Troubleshooting

**Q: My rule isn't executing. What do I check?**
A: In order:
1. Is `enabled: true`?
2. Do ALL conditions match? (use test data)
3. Are booking records being created?
4. Check CloudWatch logs

**Q: Slack message looks wrong. How do I debug?**
A: Run template tests:
```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_slack_integration.py -k "template" -v
```

**Q: I messed up the YAML. How do I undo?**
A: 
1. Stop - don't commit the broken config
2. Restore backup: `cp config/rules.yaml.backup config/rules.yaml`
3. Run validation: `python scripts/print_rules.py`
4. Try again

**Q: How long does a Lambda execution take?**
A: Typically 200-500ms. CloudWatch shows exact time in logs.

#### Getting Help

**Q: I need to add a brand new condition type. What do I do?**
A: Contact developer. You can't add new condition types via YAML only.

**Q: Can I have if/else logic in rules?**
A: Not yet. Current system uses AND logic only. Feature requested for Story 6.7.

**Q: Where do I report issues with rules?**
A: 
1. Slack channel: #operations-rules
2. GitHub issues: Label `rule-management`
3. Email: dev-team@company.com

### 12. Known Limitations and Future Work (AC 9)

#### Current Limitations (v1.0)

1. **No OR Logic in Conditions**
   - Current: ALL conditions must match (AND)
   - Workaround: Create separate rules
   - Future: Story 6.7 will add OR support

2. **Manual Slack Template Validation**
   - Current: Must test via `pytest` commands
   - Workaround: Run integration tests before deployment
   - Future: Auto-validation in pre-commit hook

3. **No Built-in Rule Testing UI**
   - Current: Test via YAML + CloudWatch logs
   - Workaround: Use test rules with `enabled: false`
   - Future: Web UI for rule testing (Story 6.8)

4. **Limited Template Variables**
   - Current: Only booking and system variables
   - Workaround: Ask dev for custom variable
   - Future: Plugin system for custom variables

5. **Rule Execution Order Not Configurable**
   - Current: Rules execute in YAML order
   - Workaround: Order rules in config by priority
   - Future: Priority field with numeric ordering

#### Post-MVP Enhancement Opportunities
