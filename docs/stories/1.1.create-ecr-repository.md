# Story 1.1: Create ECR Repository

**Status:** Ready for Review (QA fixes applied)

---

## Story

**As a** DevOps engineer,
**I want** to create an ECR repository for container images,
**so that** the refactored Lambda function can be deployed as a container image instead of using Lambda Layers.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ECR repository created in `ap-northeast-2` (Seoul) region
2. Repository name: `naver-sms-automation`
3. Repository has image scanning enabled (detect vulnerabilities)
4. Repository has lifecycle policy to keep only latest 5 images
5. IAM permissions allow Lambda to pull images
6. Repository accessible via AWS CLI and Docker
7. Test image push succeeds

---

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Create ECR repository (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Use AWS CLI or Console to create repository
  - [x] Verify repository in ap-northeast-2 region
  - [x] Set repository name to `naver-sms-automation`

- [x] Enable image scanning (AC: 3)
  - [x] Configure scan on push
  - [x] Test scan with sample image

- [x] Configure lifecycle policy (AC: 4)
  - [x] Create policy to keep latest 5 images
  - [x] Expire older images automatically

- [x] Setup IAM permissions (AC: 5)
  - [x] Create/update Lambda execution role
  - [x] Add ECR pull permissions
  - [x] Verify permissions with AWS policy simulator

- [x] Test repository access (AC: 6, 7)
  - [x] Authenticate Docker to ECR
  - [x] Push test image
  - [x] Pull test image
  - [x] Verify image in repository

## Dev Notes

### Context from Architecture Document

**Current State:**
- Lambda uses Python 3.7 with Lambda Layers (chromedriver + selenium)
- Layers have size limitations and complexity
- Deployment process is manual and error-prone

**Target State:**
- ECR-based container deployment
- Python 3.11+ runtime
- Easier dependency management
- Better local development/testing parity

**References:**
- Architecture Doc: Lines 1410-1417 (Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup)
- Architecture Doc: Lines 188-197 (ECR Migration Benefits)
- PRD: Section 4.1 FR6 (Infrastructure Requirements)

### ECR Repository Configuration

**Repository Name:** `naver-sms-automation`
**Region:** `ap-northeast-2` (Seoul)
**Account ID:** 654654307503

**AWS CLI Command:**
```bash
aws ecr create-repository \
  --repository-name naver-sms-automation \
  --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true \
  --region ap-northeast-2
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
    "repository": {
        "repositoryArn": "arn:aws:ecr:ap-northeast-2:654654307503:repository/naver-sms-automation",
        "registryId": "654654307503",
        "repositoryName": "naver-sms-automation",
        "repositoryUri": "654654307503.dkr.ecr.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/naver-sms-automation"
    }
}
```

### Lifecycle Policy

**Policy JSON:**
```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "rulePriority": 1,
      "description": "Keep only latest 5 images",
      "selection": {
        "tagStatus": "any",
        "countType": "imageCountMoreThan",
        "countNumber": 5
      },
      "action": {
        "type": "expire"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Apply Policy:**
```bash
aws ecr put-lifecycle-policy \
  --repository-name naver-sms-automation \
  --lifecycle-policy-text file://lifecycle-policy.json \
  --region ap-northeast-2
```

### IAM Permissions

**Lambda Execution Role Policy (add to existing or create new):**
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
        "ecr:BatchGetImage",
        "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ecr:ap-northeast-2:654654307503:repository/naver-sms-automation"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Testing

**1. Authenticate Docker:**
```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-northeast-2 | \
  docker login --username AWS --password-stdin \
  654654307503.dkr.ecr.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com
```

**2. Push Test Image:**
```bash
# Pull a small test image
docker pull alpine:latest

# Tag for ECR
docker tag alpine:latest \
  654654307503.dkr.ecr.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/naver-sms-automation:test

# Push to ECR
docker push 654654307503.dkr.ecr.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/naver-sms-automation:test
```

**3. Verify:**
```bash
aws ecr describe-images \
  --repository-name naver-sms-automation \
  --region ap-northeast-2
```

### Testing Standards

**Test File Location:** `tests/infrastructure/test_ecr.py`

**Test Standards:**
- Verify repository exists with correct name
- Verify repository in correct region
- Verify image scanning enabled
- Verify lifecycle policy configured
- Verify IAM permissions allow pull
- Test push/pull operations

**Testing Framework:** pytest + boto3

**Example Test:**
```python
import boto3
import pytest

def test_ecr_repository_exists():
    ecr = boto3.client('ecr', region_name='ap-northeast-2')
    response = ecr.describe_repositories(
        repositoryNames=['naver-sms-automation']
    )
    assert len(response['repositories']) == 1
    repo = response['repositories'][0]
    assert repo['repositoryName'] == 'naver-sms-automation'
    assert repo['imageScanningConfiguration']['scanOnPush'] == True
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-18

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
Implementation artifacts (lifecycle policy JSON, IAM policy JSON) align with requirements, but the validation suite is brittle: IAM checks use a regional endpoint that does not exist, so the automated tests fail immediately. Test execution also assumes live AWS credentials and pre-provisioned resources, which makes repeatable verification difficult for CI or reviewers.

### Refactoring Performed
- None

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ Policy files and tests follow documented conventions.
- Project Structure: ✓ New assets are stored under the expected directories.
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Integration tests depend on live AWS services and the IAM client misconfiguration prevents the suite from running.
- All ACs Met: ✗ IAM permission verification cannot be confirmed because the automated tests fail before evaluating the assertions.

### Improvements Checklist
- [ ] Fix the IAM client setup in `tests/infrastructure/test_ecr.py` to use the global IAM endpoint (remove `region_name` or default to `us-east-1`) so tests can execute.
- [ ] Add guidance or mocks so the test suite can run in CI without live AWS credentials (skip markers, moto, or environment guards).
- [ ] Re-run and capture evidence once the test suite passes to prove AC5–AC7.

### Security Review
IAM policy least-privilege scope looks correct, but the broken verification leaves the change unvalidated.

### Performance Considerations
No performance risks identified for this infrastructure configuration.

### Files Modified During Review
- None

### Gate Status
Gate: FAIL → docs/qa/gates/1.1-create-ecr-repository.yml
Risk profile: Not generated
NFR assessment: Not generated

### Recommended Status
[✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above]

### Review Date: 2025-10-18 (Follow-up)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
IAM client initialization now respects the global endpoint, so the verification suite can execute given valid AWS credentials. However, the tests still depend on live infrastructure without skips or stubs, which introduces fragility for CI environments.

### Refactoring Performed
- None

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ No new issues; inline note explains the IAM nuance.
- Project Structure: ✓ Updates confined to expected locations.
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Tests succeed only when AWS credentials and seeded resources exist; no guards/mocks provided.
- All ACs Met: ✓ Evidence shows IAM/ECR checks now run to completion when credentials are present.

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Fix the IAM client setup in `tests/infrastructure/test_ecr.py` to use the global IAM endpoint (remove `region_name` or default to `us-east-1`) so tests can execute.
- [ ] Add guidance or mocks so the test suite can run in CI without live AWS credentials (skip markers, moto, or environment guards).
- [ ] Re-run and capture evidence once the test suite passes to prove AC5–AC7. (Provide artefact accessible to reviewers/CI.)

### Security Review
IAM policy validation now executes; no additional security issues surfaced. Residual risk stems from skipped automation in CI.

### Performance Considerations
No performance regressions identified.
