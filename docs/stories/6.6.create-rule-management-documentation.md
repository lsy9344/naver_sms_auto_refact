# Story 6.6: Create Rule Management Documentation

**Status:** Draft *(depends on Stories 6.2–6.4 and 6.1 deliverables)*

---

## Quick Project Assessment

**Current System Context**
- [x] Rule engine configuration lives in `config/rules.yaml`, but operator-facing guidance is limited to a skeletal section in `docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide`. [Source: docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide]
- [x] Prior stories introduce Slack integration (Story 6.2) and new condition evaluators (Stories 6.3 & 6.4), yet documentation does not explain how business users enable/disable or test these features. [Source: docs/testing/slack-integration.md]
- [x] Existing docs such as `docs/rules/rules-config.md` focus on developer perspective, lacking checklists, templates, or change control guidance for non-technical operators. [Source: docs/rules/rules-config.md]

**Change Scope**
- [x] Produce a comprehensive rule management guide (mark as v1.0) describing configuration structure, condition/action catalogue, templates, testing, enablement, and rollback. [Source: docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide]
- [x] Provide companion quick-reference artifacts (e.g., YAML snippets, enable/disable checklist, testing flow) to reduce reliance on developers. [Source: docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#success-criteria]
- [x] Ensure documentation covers new Slack templates, `date_range`, and `has_multiple_options` behaviours introduced in this epic. [Source: docs/stories/6.1.implement-example-rules-from-requirements.md]

## Story

**As a** business operations lead,  
**I want** a self-service rule management guide and checklists,  
**so that** I can enable, tune, or disable automation rules safely without developer intervention.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide` is expanded into a detailed, versioned guide covering rule anatomy, condition/action catalog (including `date_range`, `has_multiple_options`, `send_slack`), configuration steps, enable/disable workflows, testing/validation, rollback, and FAQ. [Source: docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide]
2. A new quick-reference checklist (`docs/rules/rule-change-checklist.md` or equivalent) provides step-by-step instructions operators must follow before and after changing rules (review, backup, test, monitor). [Source: docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide]
3. Slack template documentation describes how to edit `config/slack_templates.yaml`, mask PII, and validate changes using the integration tests and manual webhook testing from Story 6.2; cross-links to `docs/testing/slack-integration.md` are included. [Source: docs/testing/slack-integration.md]
4. Testing guidance instructs operators how to run regression and targeted tests (`pytest` commands, data setup), interpret results, and revert configuration if tests fail. [Source: docs/testing/rule-engine-tests.md]
5. Documentation includes example YAML snippets for the “Expert Correction Slack Digest” and “Holiday Event Customer List” rules delivered in Story 6.1, showing how to adjust keywords, date ranges, channels, and templates safely. [Source: docs/stories/6.1.implement-example-rules-from-requirements.md]
6. Monitoring and rollback expectations are captured: the operator checklist defines specific signals to watch, explicit rollback triggers, and the parties responsible for observing them, with clear linkage back to the main guide. [Source: docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide]
7. The guide documents a rollout communication plan (stakeholders, channel, timing) and the process for collecting and acting on feedback (e.g., dedicated issue label or ops retro agenda). [Source: docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide]
8. Verification steps for command snippets are specified, including a documented dry run of pytest commands before publication and how to record results in the changelog. [Source: docs/testing/rule-engine-tests.md]
9. The changelog or future-work section highlights post-MVP opportunities or known limitations (e.g., automation of Slack template validation) so follow-up work is tracked. [Source: docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Expand business-facing guide (AC: 1, 3, 5)  
  - [ ] Author full sections (Overview, Rule Anatomy, Conditions, Actions, Templates, Enable/Disable, Testing, Troubleshooting, FAQ) in `docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide`, referencing newly delivered capabilities. [Source: docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide]  
  - [ ] Document Slack template management, including masking, multiline formatting, and testing instructions referencing Story 6.2 deliverables. [Source: docs/testing/slack-integration.md]

- [ ] Task 2: Produce operator checklist (AC: 2, 4)  
  - [ ] Create `docs/rules/rule-change-checklist.md` (or similar) detailing pre-change, change, and post-change steps (backups, YAML validation, test execution, monitoring signals, rollback triggers, observer assignments). [Source: docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide]  
  - [ ] Link the checklist from the main guide and Story 6.1 acceptance criteria to ensure visibility. [Source: docs/stories/6.1.implement-example-rules-from-requirements.md]

- [ ] Task 3: Update supporting docs (AC: 3, 4)  
  - [ ] Cross-reference Slack testing steps in `docs/testing/slack-integration.md`, noting new templates, environment toggles, and manual webhook verification. [Source: docs/testing/slack-integration.md]  
  - [ ] Update `docs/rules/rules-config.md` with the finalized condition/action catalog, linking to operator-facing descriptions. [Source: docs/rules/rules-config.md]

- [ ] Task 4: Review and version documentation (AC: 1)  
  - [ ] Add version header and changelog entry for the rule management guide (v1.0), capturing authorship and release date. [Source: docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide]  
  - [ ] Ensure documentation references align with reality (e.g., correct file paths, command examples) via internal review before marking story complete, and document the verification run (commands executed, date, reviewer) in the changelog.

- [ ] Task 5: Operational readiness (AC: 6, 7, 8, 9)  
  - [ ] Add rollout communication plan details (audience, channel, timeline) and feedback loop expectations to the guide. [Source: docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide]

## Dev Notes

- **Dependencies:** Wait for Stories 6.2–6.4 and 6.1 to land so guide content reflects shipped functionality. [Source: docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#stories-in-this-epic]  
- **Audience:** Write in non-technical language, emphasize safety checks, include screenshots or command snippets where useful.  
- **Versioning:** Keep guide date/version at top; future updates can increment version and add to changelog.  
- **Validation:** Run through checklist with a sample change to ensure instructions are actionable, record the commands executed and outcomes, and file any follow-up tasks for future enhancements (e.g., automating Slack template validation).

### Testing

- `pytest` commands in guide should be validated locally once (dry run) to confirm accuracy.  
- Spell-check / Markdown linting via existing tooling (if available) before publishing.

**Compatibility Verification**
- [x] No code changes introduced  
- [x] Documentation additions only  
- [x] No deployment impact  
- [x] Accessible via repo for business stakeholders
