# Story 6.6: Create Rule Management Documentation

**Status:** Done *(completed 2025-10-24)*

---

## Quick Project Assessment

**Current System Context**
- [x] Rule engine configuration lives in `config/rules.yaml`, but operator-facing guidance is limited to a skeletal section in `docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide`. [Source: docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide]
- [x] Prior stories introduce Slack integration (Story 6.2) and new condition evaluators (Stories 6.3 & 6.4), yet documentation does not explain how business users enable/disable or test these features. [Source: docs/testing/slack-integration.md]
- [x] Existing docs such as `docs/rules/rules-config.md` focus on developer perspective, lacking checklists, templates, or change control guidance for non-technical operators. [Source: docs/rules/rules-config.md]

**Change Scope**
- [x] Produce a comprehensive rule management guide (mark as v1.0) describing configuration structure, condition/action catalogue, templates, testing, enablement, and rollback. [Source: docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide]
- [x] Provide companion quick-reference artifacts (e.g., YAML snippets, enable/disable checklist, testing flow) to reduce reliance on developers. [Source: docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#success-criteria]
- [x] Ensure documentation covers new Slack templates, `date_range`, and `has_multiple_options` behaviours introduced in this epic. [Source: docs/stories/6.1.implement-example-rules-from-requirements.md]

## Story

**As a** business operations lead,  
**I want** a self-service rule management guide and checklists,  
**so that** I can enable, tune, or disable automation rules safely without developer intervention.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide` is expanded into a detailed, versioned guide covering rule anatomy, condition/action catalog (including `date_range`, `has_multiple_options`, `send_slack`), configuration steps, enable/disable workflows, testing/validation, rollback, and FAQ. [Source: docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide]
2. Create `docs/rules/rule-change-checklist.md` providing step-by-step instructions operators must follow before and after changing rules (review, backup, test, monitor). [Source: docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide]
3. Slack template documentation describes how to edit `config/slack_templates.yaml`, mask PII, and validate changes using the integration tests and manual webhook testing from Story 6.2; cross-links to `docs/testing/slack-integration.md` are included. [Source: docs/testing/slack-integration.md]
4. Testing guidance instructs operators how to run regression and targeted tests (`pytest` commands, data setup), interpret results, and revert configuration if tests fail. [Source: docs/testing/rule-engine-tests.md]
5. Documentation includes example YAML snippets for the “Expert Correction Slack Digest” and “Holiday Event Customer List” rules delivered in Story 6.1, showing how to adjust keywords, date ranges, channels, and templates safely. [Source: docs/stories/6.1.implement-example-rules-from-requirements.md]
6. Monitoring and rollback expectations are captured: the operator checklist defines specific signals to watch, explicit rollback triggers, and the parties responsible for observing them, with clear linkage back to the main guide. [Source: docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide]
7. The guide documents a rollout communication plan (stakeholders, channel, timing) and the process for collecting and acting on feedback (e.g., dedicated issue label or ops retro agenda). [Source: docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide]
8. Verification steps for command snippets are specified, including a documented dry run of pytest commands before publication and how to record results in the changelog. [Source: docs/testing/rule-engine-tests.md]
9. The changelog or future-work section highlights post-MVP opportunities or known limitations (e.g., automation of Slack template validation) so follow-up work is tracked. [Source: docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide]

## Dev Notes

- **Dependencies:** Wait for Stories 6.2–6.4 and 6.1 to land so guide content reflects shipped functionality. [Source: docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#stories-in-this-epic]  
- **Audience:** Write in non-technical language, emphasize safety checks, include screenshots or command snippets where useful.  
- **Versioning:** Keep guide date/version at top; future updates can increment version and add to changelog.  
- **Validation:** Run through checklist with a sample change to ensure instructions are actionable, record the commands executed and outcomes, and file any follow-up tasks for future enhancements (e.g., automating Slack template validation).

### Testing

- Run and document the following dry-run commands before publishing the guide:
  - `pytest tests/integration/test_slack_integration.py::TestSendSlackAction::test_send_slack_with_static_message -v`
  - `pytest --no-cov tests/integration/test_rules_regression.py::TestSlackEnabledRegression::test_booking_009_expert_correction_slack_digest`
  - `pytest tests/integration/test_rule_engine_integration.py::TestRealWorldRuleScenarios::test_new_booking_flow -v`
- Record command outcomes and the reviewer/date in the guide changelog.
- Spell-check / Markdown linting via existing tooling (if available) before publishing.
