# Story 3.3: Implement Action Executors

**Status:** Done

---

## Quick Project Assessment

**Current System Context**
- [x] Legacy actions identified in `original_code/lambda_function.py:140-205, 439-446` and `original_code/sens_sms.py`.
- [x] Technology stack: Python 3.11 Lambda container, DynamoDB repositories (Story 2.3), SENS client (Story 2.2), configuration loader (Story 2.4).
- [x] Integration points: `RuleEngine.execute_rule`, notifications layer, DynamoDB repositories, Telegram/Slack notification services.
- [x] Existing patterns: Async-capable executors registered in rule engine (`docs/brownfield-architecture.md:1140-1165`).

**Change Scope**
- [x] Actions implemented in `src/rules/actions.py` using dependency injection for repositories/services.
- [x] Boundaries: interacts with SMS client, DynamoDB repositories, notification services; no direct HTTP calls elsewhere.
- [x] Success Criteria: parity with legacy side effects (SMS sent, DynamoDB updated, Telegram alerts) validated via regression harness.

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to provide rule engine action executors that encapsulate all side effects,
**so that** declarative rules can trigger SMS sends, database updates, and notifications identical to the legacy system.

---

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: `RuleEngine.execute_rule`, registries in `src/rules/__init__.py`, DynamoDB repositories, notification services.
- Technology: Python async-capable functions (awaited or run via event loop), boto3 DynamoDB client, SENS REST API, Telegram/Slack webhooks.
- Follows pattern: Architecture guidance for action executors (`docs/brownfield-architecture.md:1140-1165`).
- Touch points: `config/rules.yaml`, `src/rules/engine.py`, `src/notifications/sms_service.py`, `src/database/dynamodb_client.py`, `src/notifications/telegram_service.py`, `src/notifications/slack_service.py`.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements**
1. Implement executor functions (`send_sms`, `create_db_record`, `update_flag`, `send_telegram`, `send_slack`, `log_event`) in `src/rules/actions.py` that mirror legacy logic, consuming dependencies from the services/repositories created in Epic 2 and masking sensitive data in logs.
2. `send_sms` delegates to the SENS client with parameters derived from rule context (template, store-specific flag) and logs success/failure; behavior matches `send_sms` calls in `original_code/lambda_function.py`.
3. `create_db_record` inserts booking records into DynamoDB with the exact schema used in the legacy flow, including `confirm_sms`, `remind_sms`, and `option_sms` flags, using the BookingRepository.
4. `update_flag` updates a single DynamoDB boolean flag and returns the updated record or success indicator consistent with legacy `update_item`; handles idempotency by short-circuiting when flag already set.
5. `send_telegram` posts messages via Telegram service with identical payload structure (from Story 2.2/2.3 extraction), supporting templated messages from rules; `send_slack` integrates with Slack webhook configuration (no-op if Slack disabled).
6. `log_event` writes structured log entries with metadata (`rule`, `action`, `booking_id`, `status`, `message`) that align with CloudWatch metric filters (Story 1.4).

**Integration Requirements**
7. Action registry helper (`register_actions(engine: RuleEngine, services: ActionServicesBundle)`) registers all executors and is invoked during application bootstrap.
8. Executors accept a shared `ActionContext` dataclass containing booking, settings, repositories, and logger references; unit tests verify immutability and safe reuse.
9. Error handling: executor exceptions are wrapped in `ActionExecutionError` with context; the rule engine logs the failure and continues evaluating remaining actions per AC from Story 3.1.

**Quality Requirements**
10. Unit tests (`tests/rules/test_actions.py`) cover success, failure, and edge cases for each executor using mocks/stubs; asynchronous behavior tested via pytest-asyncio.
11. Integration tests (`tests/integration/test_rule_actions.py`) run against local DynamoDB and stubbed notification services to ensure side effects (DB writes, SMS call, notifications) execute end-to-end.
12. Documentation (`docs/rules/actions.md`) explains each executor, required context keys, and how to add new actions; validation evidence (test results, regression comparisons) appended to `VALIDATION.md`.

## Dev Notes

### ActionContext Dataclass Structure

All action executors receive a shared `ActionContext` object containing:

```python
@dataclass
class ActionContext:
    """
    Immutable context passed to all action executors.
    Contains all dependencies needed for side effects.
    """
    booking: Booking                          # Current booking (from src/domain/booking.py)
    settings: Settings                        # Configuration (from src/config/settings.py)
    db_repo: BookingRepository               # DynamoDB repository for booking records
    sms_service: SmsService                  # SENS SMS client (from src/notifications/sms_service.py)
    telegram_service: TelegramService        # Telegram webhook client
    slack_service: SlackService              # Slack webhook client
    logger: logging.Logger                    # Structured logger with redaction
```

**Key Notes:**
- Context is immutable - no executor may modify it
- All services are injected, enabling unit testing via mocks
- Booking must be the current record being processed
- Settings provides timezone, feature flags, and configurations

### ActionServicesBundle Dataclass

The services bundle passed to `register_actions()`:

```python
@dataclass
class ActionServicesBundle:
    """
    Bundle of services needed by action executors.
    Passed to register_actions() during application bootstrap.
    """
    db_repo: BookingRepository               # DynamoDB operations
    sms_service: SmsService                  # SENS SMS API client
    telegram_service: TelegramService        # Telegram webhook (from Story 2.2)
    slack_service: SlackService              # Slack webhook (from Story 2.2)
    logger: logging.Logger                   # Application logger with redaction
```

### DynamoDB Booking Schema Reference

Refer to `src/domain/booking.py` (Booking dataclass):
- `booking_num`: str (composite key "{biz_id}_{book_id}")
- `phone`: str (sort key, customer phone)
- `name`: str (customer name)
- `booking_time`: str ("YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" format)
- `confirm_sms`: bool (flag = confirmation SMS sent)
- `remind_sms`: bool (flag = 2-hour reminder SMS sent)
- `option_sms`: bool (flag = event/option SMS sent)
- `option_time`: str (reserved field for future use)
- `extra_fields`: Dict[str, Any] (dynamic expansion support)

**AC 3 Context:** `create_db_record` must insert using this exact schema from Booking model.

### Service Dependencies from Epic 2

From Story 2.2 (Extract SENS SMS Module):
- `SmsService` - Interface for sending SMS via SENS REST API
- Methods: `send_sms(phone, template_id, store_id=None)` → returns success/failure

From Story 2.3 (Extract DynamoDB Operations):
- `BookingRepository` - DynamoDB repository for bookings
- Methods: `create(booking)`, `update_flag(booking_id, flag_name, value)`, `get(booking_id)`

From Story 2.2 (Telegram/Slack extraction context):
- `TelegramService` - Webhook client for Telegram Bot API
- `SlackService` - Webhook client for Slack APIs (may be disabled)

From Story 2.4 (Configuration Loader):
- Slack enable/disable flag: `settings.slack_enabled` or similar from config

### Error Handling Pattern

Define `ActionExecutionError` exception:

```python
@dataclass
class ActionExecutionError(Exception):
    """
    Wraps executor exceptions with context for rule engine handling.
    """
    executor_name: str                       # Which executor failed (send_sms, create_db_record, etc.)
    booking_id: str                          # Which booking triggered the error
    original_error: Exception                # Original exception from executor
    context_data: Dict[str, Any]             # Additional context (rule name, etc.)
    
    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return (f"Action '{self.executor_name}' failed for booking {self.booking_id}: "
                f"{str(self.original_error)}")
```

**Usage Pattern in Executors:**
```python
def send_sms(context: ActionContext, template: str, store_specific: bool = False):
    try:
        # SMS sending logic
        result = context.sms_service.send_sms(...)
    except Exception as e:
        raise ActionExecutionError(
            executor_name="send_sms",
            booking_id=context.booking.booking_num,
            original_error=e,
            context_data={"template": template, "store_specific": store_specific}
        )
```

### Async Execution Model

**Decision:** Executors are synchronous functions returning results (not async def)
- Rule engine calls executors sequentially
- If async needed in future, wrap executor calls with async context manager
- Current implementation: all I/O (boto3, requests) uses sync/blocking calls
- Lambda timeout sufficient for sequential execution

**Future:** If async executors needed in Epic 4+, use:
```python
async def send_sms_async(context, template):
    # Async implementation
    pass

# Run in event loop
asyncio.run(send_sms_async(context, template))
```

### Legacy Code Reference for Verification

Use these line ranges to verify action parity:
- `original_code/lambda_function.py:140-205` - Main action logic
- `original_code/lambda_function.py:150` - create_db_record pattern (put_item)
- `original_code/lambda_function.py:152, 164, 191` - send_sms calls with different templates
- `original_code/lambda_function.py:163, 167, 190` - update_item (flag updates)
- `original_code/lambda_function.py:439-446` - Telegram webhook calls
- `original_code/sens_sms.py` - SMS template mappings and SENS client usage

### Testing Standards

From architecture and existing patterns:
- **Test Framework:** pytest
- **Async Testing:** pytest-asyncio for async functions
- **Unit Test Location:** `tests/rules/test_actions.py`
- **Integration Test Location:** `tests/integration/test_rule_actions.py`
- **Mocking:** Use `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock` for services
- **DynamoDB Testing:** Use `moto` for local DynamoDB or create fixtures
- **Fixtures:** Use conftest.py for shared ActionContext, test bookings, mock services
- **Coverage Requirement:** No explicit requirement in AC, but aim for >85%

---

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Use dependency bundle (repositories, sms client, notification services) passed to registry; executors remain pure functions aside from calling injected services.
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** `docs/brownfield-architecture.md:394-465` mapping of legacy actions to new executors.
- **Key Constraints:** Preserve legacy payloads for SENS/Telegram; ensure DynamoDB schema unchanged; maintain logging format for metrics.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-19

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT**

The implementation demonstrates high-quality code with comprehensive test coverage, proper error handling, and excellent adherence to design patterns. All 6 action executors are implemented with clear separation of concerns and dependency injection.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ All 6 executors properly implemented with consistent patterns
- ✅ Immutable `ActionContext` using `@dataclass(frozen=True)` ensures thread-safety
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with `ActionExecutionError` wrapping
- ✅ 39 unit + integration tests, all passing (100% pass rate)
- ✅ Clean code: Zero flake8 violations, proper docstrings
- ✅ Idempotency correctly implemented in `update_flag()`
- ✅ Type hints throughout (fixed mypy issue during review)
- ✅ Excellent test coverage: unit tests, integration tests, workflow scenarios
- ✅ Registration pattern correctly wires all executors via `register_actions()`

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `src/rules/actions.py`
  - **Change**: Fixed type safety issue in `update_flag()` method (line 389-393)
  - **Why**: Original code called `.get()` on union type `Booking | dict[str, Any]`, which caused mypy strict mode error
  - **How**: Added type guard `isinstance(current, dict)` to safely extract flag value from both dict and Booking object formats
  - **Impact**: Code now passes mypy strict type checking while maintaining backwards compatibility with both return types from `get_booking()`

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ (flake8: 0 violations, consistent style)
- Project Structure: ✓ (follows established patterns in src/rules/)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ (unit + integration tests with proper mocking)
- All ACs Met: ✓ (All 12 acceptance criteria fulfilled)

### Acceptance Criteria Verification

**Functional Requirements**
- ✅ AC1: All 6 executors implemented in `src/rules/actions.py` with dependency injection
- ✅ AC2: `send_sms()` delegates to SENS client with template mapping (confirm/guide/event), matches legacy behavior
- ✅ AC3: `create_db_record()` inserts with exact schema (booking_num, phone, name, booking_time, SMS flags, option_time)
- ✅ AC4: `update_flag()` updates single boolean flags with idempotency (skips if already set)
- ✅ AC5: `send_telegram()` and `send_slack()` implemented; Slack correctly no-ops when disabled
- ✅ AC6: `log_event()` writes structured logs with metadata (rule, action, booking_id, status, message)

**Integration Requirements**
- ✅ AC7: `register_actions()` helper registers all 6 executors with RuleEngine via wrapper functions
- ✅ AC8: `ActionContext` is frozen dataclass ensuring immutability; safe for concurrent reuse
- ✅ AC9: Error handling wraps exceptions in `ActionExecutionError` with full context

**Quality Requirements**
- ✅ AC10: 28 unit tests in `tests/rules/test_actions.py` cover success, failure, edge cases, idempotency, immutability
- ✅ AC11: 11 integration tests in `tests/integration/test_rule_actions.py` test workflows, error recovery, flag updates
- ✅ AC12: Complete documentation in `docs/rules/actions.md` with executor signatures, examples, and adding new actions guide

**Test Results:**
```
tests/rules/test_actions.py ............................ 28 PASSED
tests/integration/test_rule_actions.py ................ 11 PASSED
Total: 39 tests PASSED (100%)
```

### Security Review

**Status: ✓ PASS**

- Immutable context prevents state leakage
- Error handling doesn't expose sensitive data (logging uses masked values via StructuredLogger)
- No SQL injection risks (boto3 native API, not raw queries)
- Service dependencies injected - no hardcoded credentials in executor code
- Idempotency prevents duplicate actions (e.g., duplicate SMS sends)

### Performance Considerations

**Status: ✓ PASS**

- Immutable context uses frozen dataclass: O(1) reference semantics
- Idempotent flag updates: skips unnecessary DB writes when flag already set
- Sequential executor model (not async): appropriate for Lambda timeout constraints
- Error isolation: one failed action doesn't block others
- No N+1 query patterns: `get_booking()` called once before update

### Files Modified During Review

- `src/rules/actions.py` - Type safety fix in `update_flag()` method

### Gate Decision

**Gate: PASS** → `docs/qa/gates/3.3-implement-action-executors.yml`

✅ All acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested
✅ Code quality excellent (0 linting violations, mypy strict passes)
✅ 39 tests passing (100% success rate)
✅ Documentation complete and thorough
✅ Error handling comprehensive and consistent

**Risk Profile: LOW**
- All legacy behaviors preserved
- Comprehensive test coverage reduces regression risk
- Idempotency prevents duplicate actions
- Immutable context prevents subtle state bugs

### Recommended Status

✓ **Ready for Done** - Story meets all acceptance criteria with excellent code quality. Recommend immediate promotion to Done status.
