# Story 3.4: Create `rules.yaml` Configuration

**Status:** Ready for review

---

## Quick Project Assessment

**Current System Context**
- [x] Legacy rule flows mapped in `original_code/lambda_function.py:120-210, 360-410`.
- [x] Supporting modules: condition evaluators (Story 3.2), action executors (Story 3.3), configuration loader (Story 2.4).
- [x] Integration points: `config/rules.yaml`, schema validation in rule engine core (Story 3.1).
- [x] Existing patterns: YAML-driven rule definitions with comments and metadata (`docs/brownfield-architecture.md:978-1015`).

**Change Scope**
- [x] Build complete `config/rules.yaml` capturing current production behavior plus future-ready toggles.
- [x] Provide schema definition and documentation for rule authors.
- [x] Success = declarative rules produce identical side effects compared to legacy logic (via regression tests).

---

## Story

**As a** product owner (authoring rules),
**I want** a declarative `rules.yaml` that encodes all current automation logic,
**so that** future rule changes require configuration edits rather than code deployments.

---

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: `Settings.load()` for configuration ingestion (Story 2.4), `RuleEngine` constructor (Story 3.1), condition/action registries (Stories 3.2, 3.3).
- Technology: YAML configuration with structured parameters (no templating in rule definitions; templating handled in SMS action executor).
- Follows pattern: Example structures from architecture doc `docs/brownfield-architecture.md:978-1035`.
- Touch points: `src/config/rules.yaml`, `src/config/rules.schema.json`, `docs/rules/rules-config.md`, regression test harness.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements**
1. `config/rules.yaml` defines all current rule flows: New Booking Confirmation, Two-Hour Reminder, Evening Option SMS, with `enabled: true`, descriptive `name`, `description`, and `tags`.
2. Each rule lists conditions and actions using the evaluator/executor identifiers established in Stories 3.2 and 3.3, with parameters matching legacy behavior (e.g., `time_before_booking` with `hours: 2`, `has_option_keyword` referencing option keyword list from config).
3. Additional scaffolding included for future rules (e.g., Slack notification template) but disabled via `enabled: false` and documentation, ensuring zero behavior change until activated.
4. YAML passes schema validation defined in `config/rules.schema.json`; schema includes enums for condition/action types, required parameter fields, and optional metadata (priority, notes).
5. Comments or `metadata:` blocks capture business context (store coverage, message templates) sourced from PRD to aid non-developer editors.

**Integration Requirements**
6. Configuration loader (Story 2.4) successfully loads rules into `Settings.rules`; sample program `scripts/print_rules.py` prints summary for verification.
7. Rule engine comparison harness processes legacy booking fixtures through new rules and confirms identical action sequences (SMS type, DB updates, notifications) recorded in `VALIDATION.md`.
8. Documentation (`docs/rules/rules-config.md`) explains file structure, editing guidelines, and testing workflow for rule authors; includes guidance on enabling/disabling rules and adding new ones safely.

**Quality Requirements**
9. Unit tests validate schema enforcement by attempting to load malformed rule definitions (missing fields, invalid types) and confirming descriptive errors.
10. YAML linting (e.g., `yamllint`, `spectral`) included in CI to guard formatting and schema conformance.
11. Versioning strategy documented: use semantic rule versions or Git tags; change log appended to file header with effective date and author.

## Dependency Checkpoints

**Before Starting Story 3.4:**
- [ ] Story 3.1 (Rule Engine Core) is MERGED - verify:
  - RuleEngine class exists at `src/rules/engine.py`
  - `evaluate_rule(rule: RuleConfig, context: Dict) -> bool` method signature documented
  - `execute_rule(rule: RuleConfig, context: Dict) -> List[ActionResult]` method signature documented
  - RuleConfig dataclass structure defined
  
- [ ] Story 3.2 (Condition Evaluators) is MERGED - verify:
  - Condition registry populated with all 8 evaluator types (from Epic 3 table)
  - Each condition's parameter schema documented (e.g., `time_before_booking` expects `hours: int`)
  
- [ ] Story 3.3 (Action Executors) is MERGED - verify:
  - Action registry populated with all 6 executor types (from Epic 3 table)
  - Each action's parameter schema documented (e.g., `send_sms` expects `template: str, store_specific: bool`)
  - Send_sms executor handles SMS templates (confirmation, guide, event)

## Dev Notes

### Source Tree Information

**File Locations:**
- Create file: `src/config/rules.yaml` (main rule configuration)
- Create file: `src/config/rules.schema.json` (JSON Schema validation)
- Configuration loader: `src/config/settings.py` (Story 2.4)
- Rule engine: `src/rules/engine.py` (Story 3.1)
- Test fixtures: `tests/fixtures/legacy_bookings.json` (5 representative booking scenarios)
- Test baseline: `tests/fixtures/legacy_expected_actions.json` (expected action sequences)
- Regression test: `tests/integration/test_rules_regression.py`
- Schema validation test: `tests/unit/test_rules_schema.py`
- Evidence: `VALIDATION.md` (regression test results)

### Integration Points

**Settings.load() Method** (`src/config/settings.py:45`)
- Loads rules.yaml from file system
- Validates against rules.schema.json using jsonschema library
- Returns populated `Settings.rules: List[RuleConfig]` attribute
- Raises descriptive ValidationError if schema invalid

**RuleEngine Constructor** (`src/rules/engine.py:20`)
- Accepts `rules_config: List[RuleConfig]` parameter
- Initializes `self.rules = rules_config`
- Pre-populated with condition_evaluators registry from Story 3.2
- Pre-populated with action_executors registry from Story 3.3

**Condition Evaluators** (from Story 3.2):
- Registry keys: `booking_not_in_db`, `time_before_booking`, `flag_not_set`, `current_hour`, `booking_status`, `has_option_keyword`, `store_id_matches`, `date_range`
- All evaluators return bool (True = condition met)
- Parameters passed as YAML dict, validated against evaluator schema

**Action Executors** (from Story 3.3):
- Registry keys: `send_sms`, `create_db_record`, `update_flag`, `send_telegram`, `send_slack`, `log_event`
- All executors return ActionResult with execution status
- Parameters passed as YAML dict, validated against executor schema

### Current Rule Patterns from Legacy Code

**Pattern 1: New Booking Confirmation** (`original_code/lambda_function.py:131-167`)
```
When: New booking detected (not in DynamoDB)
Conditions: booking_not_in_db
Actions: 
  1. create_db_record() - Insert new booking into SMS tracking table
  2. send_sms(template='confirmation') - Send confirmation SMS via SENS API
  3. send_telegram(message='...') - Notify via Telegram
Expected: 1 confirmation SMS per new booking
```

**Pattern 2: Two-Hour Reminder** (`original_code/lambda_function.py:160-175`)
```
When: Booking in next 2 hours AND reminder not yet sent
Conditions:
  - time_before_booking(hours=2) - Now is within 2 hours before booking
  - flag_not_set(flag='remind_sms') - DynamoDB remind_sms flag is false
Actions:
  1. send_sms(template='guide', store_specific=true) - Send guide SMS with store-specific info
  2. update_flag(flag='remind_sms', value=true) - Mark reminder as sent in DynamoDB
Expected: 1 reminder SMS per booking, sent at correct time
```

**Pattern 3: Evening Option SMS** (`original_code/lambda_function.py:176-195`)
```
When: Current time is 20:00 (8 PM) AND customer has option AND option SMS not yet sent
Conditions:
  - current_hour(hour=20) - Current time is 8 PM
  - flag_not_set(flag='option_sms') - DynamoDB option_sms flag is false
  - has_option_keyword(keywords=['네이버', '인스타', '원본']) - Customer selected option with matching keyword
Actions:
  1. send_sms(template='event') - Send event/option SMS via SENS API
  2. update_flag(flag='option_sms', value=true) - Mark option SMS as sent in DynamoDB
Expected: 1 option SMS per booking with matching keywords, sent at 8 PM
```

### Testing Standards

**Framework:** pytest (follows `tests/` directory structure)

**Test Locations:**
- Unit tests for schema validation: `tests/unit/test_rules_schema.py`
- Regression test harness: `tests/integration/test_rules_regression.py`
- Fixtures: `tests/fixtures/legacy_bookings.json`, `tests/fixtures/legacy_expected_actions.json`

**Coverage Requirement:** >90% for rules module (rules.yaml processing, schema validation, regression tests)

**Test Patterns:**
- Schema validation: Load valid rules.yaml ✅ Should parse; Load malformed YAML ❌ Should raise ValidationError with descriptive message
- Regression: For each booking fixture → Process through new rule engine → Compare action sequence against baseline → Assert 100% match
- Integration: Load rules.yaml → Initialize RuleEngine → Process sample booking → Verify expected actions executed

### Schema Validation Strategy

**Format:** JSON Schema (draft-07)

**Validation Library:** jsonschema (Python)

**Timing:** Validation occurs in `Settings.load()` on startup
  - File loads as YAML, converted to Python dict
  - jsonschema validates dict against rules.schema.json
  - Descriptive error messages logged to CloudWatch
  - Process fails if schema invalid (prevents bad rules deployment)

**CI Integration:**
- Pre-commit hook: yamllint for YAML formatting (no trailing spaces, proper indentation)
- CI pipeline step: spectral for schema validation against rules.schema.json
- Both must pass before merge to main

---

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** YAML consumed by configuration loader (Story 2.4), converted to `RuleConfig` dataclasses by rule engine core (Story 3.1).
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Mapping table in Epic 3 and architecture doc lines 394-465 for condition/action equivalence.
- **Key Constraints:** No behavior changes allowed; ensure keyword lists, store IDs align with configuration files from Epic 2.

**Task 3: Integrate with Configuration Loader** (AC: 6)
- [ ] Update `src/config/settings.py` to load rules.yaml in Settings class
- [ ] Implement Settings.load() method to:
  - Read rules.yaml from file system
  - Parse YAML into Python dict
  - Validate dict against rules.schema.json using jsonschema
  - Convert validated dict to List[RuleConfig] dataclass objects
  - Set Settings.rules attribute
  - Raise descriptive ValidationError if schema invalid
- [ ] Verify RuleConfig dataclass exists and includes all required fields (from Story 3.1)
- [ ] Create `scripts/print_rules.py` to load rules and print summary (for verification)
  - Print: total rules count, enabled/disabled count, condition types used, action types used

**Task 4: Create Regression Test Harness** (AC: 7)
- [ ] Create fixture file `tests/fixtures/legacy_bookings.json` with 5 representative booking scenarios
  - Booking 1: New booking (no DB record)
  - Booking 2: Booking in 2-hour window (remind_sms not set)
  - Booking 3: Booking at 8 PM with option keyword (option_sms not set)
  - Booking 4: Booking already processed (all flags set)
  - Booking 5: Booking from non-matching store
- [ ] Create baseline file `tests/fixtures/legacy_expected_actions.json` with expected action sequences
  - For each booking fixture, record exact actions that should execute:
    - Action type (send_sms, update_flag, etc.)
    - Parameters (template type, flag name, etc.)
    - Expected outcome (SMS sent, DB updated, etc.)
- [ ] Implement `tests/integration/test_rules_regression.py`:
  - Load rules.yaml and initialize RuleEngine
  - For each booking fixture:
    1. Call RuleEngine.process_booking(booking)
    2. Capture action sequence from rule execution
    3. Compare against baseline sequence
    4. Assert exact match (same action types, same parameters, same order)
    5. Record result (pass/fail) with timestamp
  - Save execution report to VALIDATION.md
  - Fail test if ANY booking produces different action sequence

**Task 5: Create Schema Validation Unit Tests** (AC: 9, 10)
- [ ] Implement `tests/unit/test_rules_schema.py`:
  - Test Case 1: Valid rules.yaml loads successfully without errors
  - Test Case 2: Missing required field `name` produces ValidationError with clear message
  - Test Case 3: Missing required field `conditions` produces ValidationError
  - Test Case 4: Invalid condition type (e.g., `invalid_type`) produces ValidationError
  - Test Case 5: Invalid action type produces ValidationError
  - Test Case 6: Missing required condition parameter (e.g., `time_before_booking` without `hours`) produces ValidationError
  - Test Case 7: Wrong parameter type (e.g., `hours: "string"` instead of int) produces ValidationError
  - Test Case 8: Empty conditions array produces ValidationError
  - Test Case 9: Optional fields (tags, priority, notes) are truly optional (no error if missing)
  - Test Case 10: Invalid enum value in send_sms template produces ValidationError

**Task 6: Setup CI Linting** (AC: 10)
- [ ] Configure yamllint in pre-commit hooks (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`):
  - Rule: YAML formatting validation for rules.yaml
  - Check: No trailing whitespace, proper indentation (2 spaces), line length <120
- [ ] Configure spectral in CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/validate.yml` or equivalent):
  - Step: Run spectral validation against rules.yaml using rules.schema.json
  - Fail build if validation fails
- [ ] Add Make target `make validate-rules` to run both checks locally
- [ ] Update CI configuration to run validation on pull requests

**Task 7: Create Documentation** (AC: 8, 11)
- [ ] Create `docs/rules/rules-config.md` with:
  - Section 1: File Structure Explanation
    - Describe YAML structure (rules array, rule objects, conditions, actions)
    - Explain enabled/disabled rule behavior
    - Show example of each condition type with parameters
    - Show example of each action type with parameters
  - Section 2: Editing Guidelines for Rule Authors
    - How to enable/disable existing rules (change `enabled: true/false`)
    - How to add new rule (copy template, update name/description/conditions/actions)
    - How to modify rule conditions (add/remove conditions, update parameters)
    - How to modify rule actions (add/remove actions, update parameters)
    - Examples: "Add rule to send SMS to store 1051707 only" + "Add rule for date range filtering"
  - Section 3: Testing Workflow
    - Steps to test rules locally before deployment
    - How to run regression test harness
    - How to interpret test results
    - How to roll back if issues detected
  - Section 4: Versioning and Change Log
    - Use semantic versioning (v1.0, v1.1, etc.)
    - Add change log entries to rules.yaml header with date, version, author, description
    - Link to Git commit for auditability
  - Section 5: Common Troubleshooting
    - "Rule not executing" → Check enabled flag, condition parameters
    - "Wrong SMS sent" → Check template name matches send_sms parameters
    - "Duplicate SMS" → Check flag update actions are present

**Task 8: Create Validation Evidence** (AC: 7, 11)
- [ ] Create `VALIDATION.md` with:
  - Section: Regression Test Results
    - Test date, executor, rules.yaml version tested
    - For each booking fixture:
      - Fixture name and description
      - Expected action sequence (from baseline)
      - Actual action sequence (from new rule engine)
      - Result (✅ PASS or ❌ FAIL)
      - Differences if any (detailed comparison)
    - Summary: Total bookings tested, pass rate, any failures
  - Section: Schema Validation Results
    - Schema version tested, validation tool (jsonschema, spectral)
    - Test date and executor
    - All test cases passed/failed count
  - Section: Change Log
    - Version 1.0 created (this story)
    - Link to commit
    - Author and date

- [ ] rules.yaml created at `src/config/rules.yaml` with 3 active rules + 2 disabled templates
- [ ] rules.schema.json created at `src/config/rules.schema.json` with valid JSON Schema
- [ ] Configuration loader (Settings.load) successfully loads and validates rules.yaml
- [ ] Regression test harness passes: 100% action sequence match with legacy system
- [ ] Schema validation tests pass: All 10 test cases pass
- [ ] CI linting configured: yamllint and spectral integrated

- [ ] Evidence captured: VALIDATION.md with regression results and schema validation results
- [ ] No warnings or errors in make fmt && make test && make lint
- [ ] All files committed to Git with descriptive commit message

---

## Risk and Compatibility Check

- **Primary Risk:** Misconfigured YAML causing missed or duplicated SMS events.  
  **Mitigation:** Regression harness, schema validation, manual review by PO/QA before deployment.
- **Rollback:** Revert to previous `rules.yaml` version via Git; rule engine loads last known good configuration.

**Compatibility Verification**
- [x] Compatible with rule engine core and evaluators/executors  
- [x] Supports future extensions (Slack, date ranges) via disabled templates  
- [x] Aligns with PRD requirement for configuration-driven rules

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-19

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: GOOD - CRITICAL INTEGRATION ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

The story has accomplished significant implementation work with excellent schema design and comprehensive documentation. However, a critical integration issue blocks regression test verification, requiring immediate fixes before production readiness.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ `rules.yaml` well-structured with 3 active rules + 2 disabled templates
- ✅ `rules.schema.json` comprehensive with proper conditional validation (using JSON Schema `allOf` + `if-then`)
- ✅ Schema validation tests: ALL 15 PASSING (100%)
- ✅ Documentation excellent: 5 detailed sections, examples, troubleshooting
- ✅ Configuration files created and integrated
- ✅ Test fixtures prepared (5 booking scenarios)

**Critical Issues Found:**
- ❌ **Regression test harness integration failure**: 2 of 5 booking scenarios fail (40% failure rate)
- ❌ Root cause: Context mismatch between test fixtures and action executor expectations
  - Test fixtures provide plain dict with nested `booking` field
  - Action executors expect `ActionContext` object with `Booking` dataclass
  - Wrappers created by `register_actions()` don't properly convert dict context to `ActionContext`

### Detailed Issue Analysis

**Issue 1: Regression Test Context Type Mismatch**

**File:** `tests/integration/test_rules_regression.py:108-121`

**Problem:**
```python
def build_context(self, booking: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    return {
        "booking": booking.get("booking", {}),  # Dict, not Booking object
        "db_record": booking.get("db_record"),
        "current_time": current_time,
    }
```

The context is a plain dict, but action executors (e.g., `send_sms:164`) expect:
```python
booking = context.booking  # Tries to access .booking attribute on dict
```

**Impact:**
- Bookings 001 (New Booking Confirmation) fails with: `'dict' object has no attribute 'booking'`
- Bookings 002, 003 fail with same error or zero actions executed
- Bookings 004, 005 appear to pass (conditions not met, so actions not executed)

**Solution Required:**
The regression test harness must construct proper domain objects:
1. Convert fixture "booking" dict to `Booking` dataclass
2. Create `ActionContext` with required services (mock DB repo, SMS service, logger)
3. Pass `ActionContext` to action wrappers, not plain dict

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ (YAML valid, schema well-formed, docstrings complete)
- Project Structure: ✓ (Files in correct locations per core-config.yaml)
- Testing Strategy: ✗ **BLOCKED** - Regression tests fail to validate AC7
- All ACs Met: ✗ **PARTIAL** - AC7 and AC11 blocked by integration issue

### Acceptance Criteria Verification

**Status: 8 of 11 PASS, 3 of 11 BLOCKED**

**Functional Requirements**
- ✅ AC1: `config/rules.yaml` defines all 3 current rules + 2 disabled templates
- ✅ AC2: Each rule uses condition/action identifiers from Stories 3.2/3.3 with matching parameters
- ✅ AC3: Disabled templates included for Slack + date-range rules
- ✅ AC4: YAML passes schema validation (all 15 schema tests pass)
- ✅ AC5: Comments and metadata capture business context (tags, priority, notes fields)

**Integration Requirements**
- ✅ AC6: Configuration loader (`Settings.load()`) successfully loads rules.yaml
- ❌ AC7: **BLOCKED** - Regression harness integration issue prevents validation
  - Setup: Schema validation passes, fixtures loaded
  - Blocker: Context type mismatch prevents action execution
  - Evidence: 2 of 5 booking tests fail with AttributeError
- ⚠️ AC8: Documentation complete, but testing workflow (Section 3) cannot be validated until AC7 fixed

**Quality Requirements**
- ✅ AC9: Schema validation tests: 15 PASSING (required fields, invalid types, enums all verified)
- ✅ AC10: `yamllint` CI integration ready (can be verified once AC7 unblocked)
- ✅ AC11: Documentation complete with all 5 sections

### Test Results Summary

**Schema Validation Tests (`tests/unit/test_rules_schema.py`):**
```
✅ 15/15 PASSED (100%)
- Valid YAML loads successfully
- Missing fields properly rejected
- Invalid types properly rejected
- Enums properly enforced
- Parameter schemas validated
```

**Regression Tests (`tests/integration/test_rules_regression.py`):**
```
❌ 3 FAILED, 18 PASSED
- Booking 001 (New Booking): FAILED - 'dict' object has no attribute 'booking'
- Booking 002 (Two-Hour Reminder): FAILED - No actions executed (0/2)
- Booking 003 (Evening Option SMS): FAILED - No actions executed (0/2)
- Bookings 004, 005: PASSED (conditions not met, 0 actions expected)
```

### Root Cause Deep Dive

The issue stems from a design mismatch in how `register_actions()` creates wrappers:

**In `src/rules/actions.py:649-680`:**
```python
def send_sms_wrapper(rule_context: Dict[str, Any], **params: Any) -> None:
    booking = rule_context.get("booking")  # Gets the "booking" field from dict
    action_context = ActionContext(
        booking=booking,  # booking is still a dict, not Booking object
        ...
    )
    send_sms(action_context, **params)
```

The wrapper retrieves `booking` from context dict (which is a plain dict), then passes it to `ActionContext`. But `ActionContext.booking` expects a `Booking` dataclass, not a dict.

**Why Some Tests Pass:**
- Booking 004, 005 have no matching conditions, so actions never execute
- Schema validation tests pass because they only validate YAML syntax, not runtime execution

### Refactoring Performed

**None yet** - Awaiting decision on how to resolve:

**Option 1 (Recommended):** Fix regression test harness to construct proper domain objects
- ✅ Aligns with AC7 requirements
- ✅ Validates end-to-end behavior
- ✅ Minimal changes to story code

**Option 2:** Modify action executors to accept dict contexts
- ❌ Breaks design intent (AC8 specifies ActionContext)
- ❌ Reduces type safety
- ❌ Creates divergence from Story 3.3

**Recommendation:** Pursue Option 1

### Security Review

**Status: ✓ PASS**

- YAML parsing: Uses safe YAML loader
- Schema validation: Prevents injection via strict enum/type enforcement
- No credentials in configuration files
- Service injection prevents hardcoded secrets

### Performance Considerations

**Status: ✓ PASS**

- YAML parsing: One-time cost at startup (Settings.load)
- Schema validation: Cached by jsonschema library
- Rule evaluation: Sequential, not optimized but acceptable for Lambda
- No N+1 query patterns in rule definitions

### Recommended Fix (Before Production)

**Fix AC7 Regression Test Integration:**

The test harness needs to convert fixture data into domain objects:

```python
# In tests/integration/test_rules_regression.py:build_context()

from src.domain.booking import Booking
from src.database.dynamodb_client import BookingRepository
from src.notifications.sms_service import SensSmsClient
from src.utils.logger import StructuredLogger
from src.rules.actions import ActionContext

def build_context(self, booking_fixture: Dict[str, Any]) -> ActionContext:
    # Convert fixture to domain objects
    booking_dict = booking_fixture.get("booking", {})
    booking = Booking(
        booking_num=booking_fixture.get("id"),
        phone=booking_dict.get("customer_phone", ""),
        name=booking_dict.get("customer_name", ""),
        booking_time=booking_dict.get("booking_time", ""),
        confirm_sms=False,
        remind_sms=booking_fixture.get("db_record", {}).get("remind_sms", False),
        option_sms=booking_fixture.get("db_record", {}).get("option_sms", False),
    )

    # Create mock services (already exists in test fixtures)
    return ActionContext(
        booking=booking,
        settings_dict={"slack_enabled": False},
        db_repo=self.mock_db_repo,
        sms_service=self.mock_sms_service,
        logger=self.mock_logger,
    )
```

This conversion:
- ✅ Honors AC8 (ActionContext immutability)
- ✅ Validates domain model contracts
- ✅ Provides end-to-end verification
- ✅ Requires minimal changes to story code

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours for dev to implement + verify

### Files Modified During Review

None (awaiting decision on fix approach)

### Gate Decision

**Gate: CONCERNS** → `docs/qa/gates/3.4-create-rules-configuration.yml`

**Rationale:**

✅ **What's Working:**
- Rules configuration created and valid
- Schema design excellent
- Schema validation tests all passing (15/15)
- Documentation comprehensive
- Integration with configuration loader verified
- 90% of ACs functionally complete

❌ **Blocking Issue:**
- Regression tests blocked by integration issue
- AC7 validation incomplete (harness context type mismatch)
- Cannot verify "identical action sequences with legacy system" as required

**Gate Decision:** CONCERNS (not FAIL) because:
- Issue is isolated to test harness integration
- Core functionality (configuration, schema, loading) works
- Fix is straightforward and low-risk
- No production code changes required, only test harness

**Recommendation:** Fix regression test context handling, then resubmit for PASS gate.

### Risk Assessment

**Technical Risk: MEDIUM (mitigation available)**
- Root cause: Clear and understood
- Fix path: Well-defined and low-risk
- Testing impact: Only affects regression test verification, not production

**Production Risk: LOW**
- Core YAML/schema configuration sound
- Action executors function correctly (Story 3.3 PASS gate)
- Disabled future rules pose no risk
- Rollback simple (revert rules.yaml Git commit)

### Improvements Checklist

**Must Fix Before Production:**
- [ ] Fix regression test harness to construct ActionContext with proper domain objects
- [ ] Re-run regression tests: expect 5/5 PASS
- [ ] Verify AC7 validated: "identical action sequences" confirmed

**Nice to Have (post-deployment):**
- [ ] Add integration test for rules.yaml modification + schema validation in CI
- [ ] Monitor CloudWatch logs for rule execution patterns
- [ ] Collect metrics on rule match rates per day

### Recommended Status

⚠️ **Changes Required - Fix AC7 Regression Test Integration**

- Story is 90% complete and well-executed
- One integration issue blocks final verification
- Fix is straightforward (1-2 hours estimated)
- After fix, story ready for Done status

### Review Date: 2025-10-19 (Follow-up)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Follow-up testing surfaced production-blocking defects in the rule configuration and regression harness despite prior fixes.

- ❌ `update_flag()` executor rejects the YAML parameters (`flag`, `value`) used in every rule. In runtime this raises `TypeError: update_flag() got an unexpected keyword argument 'flag'`, preventing reminder/option flags from updating and causing repeat SMS attempts. (Ref: `src/rules/actions.py:329-410`, `src/config/rules.yaml:74-82`, reproduced via script mirroring the regression harness.)
- ❌ Regression fixtures still omit the `reserve_at` datetime that `time_before_booking` expects. Rules 2 & 3 never trigger, so AC7’s “identical action sequences” cannot be validated. (Ref: `tests/integration/test_rules_regression.py:154-199`.)
- ❌ Mocked repository in the regression suite still returns `None`, so even with the above fixed the `update_flag` action would throw a ValueError on every run. (Ref: `tests/integration/test_rules_regression.py:310-313`.)
- ⚠️ Booking option data in fixtures is stored as the literal string `"네이버"`, while the condition code expects a boolean flag or keyword list. Evening Option SMS coverage therefore remains unverified.

### Refactoring Performed

None – defects documented for development follow-up.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✗ (Action executor contract broken for flag updates.)
- Project Structure: ✓
- Testing Strategy: ✗ (Regression suite cannot exercise critical flows due to fixture gaps and service mocks.)
- All ACs Met: ✗ (AC2 & AC7 fail – action parameters do not align with executor contract, and regression harness still cannot validate legacy parity.)

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Align `update_flag` executor signature with YAML schema (`flag`/`value`) or update both schema and rules to use `flag_name`/`flag_value`.
- [ ] Extend regression fixture builder to set `reserve_at` (parsed from `booking_time`) and supply option keywords/flags so Rule 2 & 3 conditions can pass.
- [ ] Make mocked `BookingRepository.get_booking` return an object/dict so `update_flag` can exercise idempotency logic.
- [ ] Re-run `pytest tests/integration/test_rules_regression.py` after fixes and capture evidence in `VALIDATION.md`.

### Security Review

- Status: ✓ PASS – No new security risks introduced in this iteration.

### Performance Considerations

- Status: ✓ PASS – All issues isolated to logic/tests; no performance regressions observed.

### Files Modified During Review

None.

### Gate Status

Gate: FAIL → docs/qa/gates/3.4-create-rules-configuration.yml (updated)

### Recommended Status

✗ Changes Required – Resolve executor parameter mismatch and restore regression coverage before promoting story.
