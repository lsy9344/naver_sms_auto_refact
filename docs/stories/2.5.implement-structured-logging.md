# Story 2.5: Implement Structured Logging

**Status:** Draft

---

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a structured logging utility that replaces ad-hoc `print()` statements with JSON logs,
**so that** CloudWatch dashboards and alerts (Epic 1) can rely on consistent observability data.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements**
1. `src/utils/logger.py` provides a logging helper (`get_logger(name)`) that outputs JSON-formatted logs with fields: `timestamp`, `level`, `logger`, `message`, `component`, `booking_id`, `store_id`, `rule_name`, `action`, and `status`; helper integrates with Python `logging` module and supports structured extra fields.
2. Redaction utility masks sensitive data (phone numbers, secrets) before log emission (e.g., `010-1234-5678` â†’ `***5678`); unit tests verify that logged messages never contain raw credentials or full phone numbers.
3. Logging configuration reads defaults from `Settings` (Story 2.4) or environment variables (`LOG_LEVEL`, `LOG_JSON_INDENT`, `ENABLE_TRACE_ID`) and initializes once per process (safe for Lambda).
4. All modules touched in Epic 2 (auth, notifications, database, config, rule engine scaffolding) replace `print()` with structured logging calls using appropriate log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR); logging context includes AWS request ID when available.
5. Logger emits metrics-friendly logs: when actions succeed/fail, log entries include `event_type` and numeric fields (`duration_ms`, `retry_count`); compatibility confirmed with CloudWatch metric filters defined in Story 1.4.

**Integration Requirements**
6. Logger integrates with AWS Lambda handler by injecting correlation IDs (e.g., `context.aws_request_id`) and supporting structured child loggers for per-booking context.
7. Unit tests cover JSON formatting, redaction, level filtering, and environment overrides; integration test runs sample Lambda invocation capturing stdout/stderr to ensure logs meet expected schema.
8. Documentation (`docs/ops/logging.md`) provides examples, log conventions, and guidance on adding new fields; includes CloudWatch Insights queries for common troubleshooting scenarios.

**Quality Requirements**
9. Static analysis (`flake8`, `pylint`, or project equivalent) confirms no unused logging functions or direct `print()` statements remain in refactored modules (CI fail if `print(` detected outside tests).
10. Logging helper performance benchmarked to ensure <1ms overhead per call in steady state; results documented in `VALIDATION.md`.
11. QA checklist updated to include verification of structured logs during release testing.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Build structured logger utility (AC: 1, 3, 6)
- [ ] Implement redaction helpers and tests (AC: 2, 7)
- [ ] Replace `print()` usage across extracted modules (AC: 4, 5, 9)
- [ ] Document logging strategy and validation evidence (AC: 8, 10, 11)

---

## Dev Notes

- **References:** Architecture requirement for structured logging (`docs/brownfield-architecture.md:770-812`), PRD monitoring goals (`docs/prd.md:134-160`), CloudWatch metrics/alarms from Story 1.4.
- **Implementation Tips:** Use `logging.LoggerAdapter` for contextual fields, configure JSON formatter via `json.dumps` with custom serializer for datetime objects, and ensure thread safety.
- **Testing Guidance:** Capture logs using `caplog` fixture in pytest; use snapshot testing to guarantee schema stability.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Logger utility implemented and adopted  
- [ ] Tests, linting, and benchmarks executed  
- [ ] Documentation and QA checklist updated  
- [ ] Validation artefacts stored

---

## Risk and Compatibility Check

- **Primary Risk:** Missing context fields hinder observability or logs leak PII.
- **Mitigation:** Redaction tests, log schema validation, manual review of sample logs.
- **Rollback:** Toggle environment variable to revert to plain text logging temporarily while investigating.

**Compatibility Verification**
- [x] Works in local dev, Lambda, and integration environments  
- [x] Supports future additions (e.g., trace IDs) without breaking schema  
- [x] Aligns with Epic 1 dashboards/alarms
