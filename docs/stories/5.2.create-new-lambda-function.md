# Story 5.2: Create New Lambda Function

**Status:** Done

---

## Quick Project Assessment

**Current System Context**
- [x] Post-migration deployment plan requires standing up `naverplace_send_inform_v2` as the container-based Lambda before any parallel executions begin (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:93-129`, `docs/brownfield-architecture.md:1348-1446`).
- [x] New function must reuse the container image published to ECR and remain separate from the legacy zip/Layers Lambda to protect production traffic (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:95-116`, `docs/brownfield-architecture.md:1361-1373`).
- [x] Execution role (`lambda-execution-role`) needs DynamoDB, Secrets Manager, and CloudWatch permissions so runtime parity with the existing automation is preserved (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:105-117`, `docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:212-217`).
- [x] Secrets access must continue through AWS Secrets Manager with no environment variables added to the container runtime (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:212-218`, `docs/infra/secrets-manager.md:1-71`).

**Change Scope**
- [x] Create the new Lambda function using the container image URI and configuration defined in the deployment epic (name, timeout, memory, region) without modifying the existing function (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:105-116`, `docs/brownfield-architecture.md:1440-1446`).
- [x] Keep the legacy EventBridge trigger untouched while registering a new, disabled rule for `naverplace_send_inform_v2` so parallel execution can be enabled later (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:117-128`, `docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:219-243`).
- [x] Capture function metadata (ARN, image digest, role bindings) for the Go/No-Go gate that precedes the parallel rollout (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:206-266`).
- [x] Validate that the Lambda execution role continues to satisfy Secrets Manager access policies after the new function is created (`docs/infra/secrets-manager.md:15-71`).

## Story

**As a** deployment engineer,  
**I want** to provision the container-based `naverplace_send_inform_v2` Lambda with the approved runtime configuration and disabled trigger,  
**so that** the team can launch the parallel deployment phase without risking the live automation workflow.

---

## Story Context

- Deployment phase mandates creating a second Lambda that points at the ECR image produced in Story 5.1 while the legacy function keeps serving traffic (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:93-129`, `docs/brownfield-architecture.md:1361-1373`).
- The Epic-level acceptance criteria enumerate the exact Lambda configuration (name, timeout, memory, role, secrets usage) required before the Go/No-Go checkpoint can pass (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:206-218`, `docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:260-266`).
- EventBridge orchestration must remain disabled for the new function until comparison monitoring is in place, preventing duplicate SMS sends before Story 5.3 completes (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:117-128`, `docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:219-224`).
- Secrets Manager policies already constrain credentials access to the Lambda execution role, so verifying role bindings after creation is part of the security guardrail (`docs/infra/secrets-manager.md:15-71`).

---

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements**
1. AWS Lambda function `naverplace_send_inform_v2` exists in `ap-northeast-2` using the container image `654654307503.dkr.ecr.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/naver-sms-automation:latest` (or the latest immutable tag) with timeout 300 seconds and memory 512 MB (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:105-114`, `docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:212-216`).
2. The function assumes the designated execution role (`arn:aws:iam::654654307503:role/lambda-execution-role` or documented equivalent) that already grants DynamoDB, Secrets Manager, and CloudWatch access (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:111-112`, `docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:212-217`).
3. No new environment variables are introduced; secrets retrieval continues exclusively through Secrets Manager as outlined in the security architecture (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:217-218`, `docs/infra/secrets-manager.md:5-71`).

**Integration Requirements**
4. The legacy Lambda (`naverplace_send_inform`) and its EventBridge schedule remain unchanged so customer SMS delivery continues uninterrupted during this story (`docs/brownfield-architecture.md:1440-1446`, `docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:238-243`).
5. A new EventBridge rule `naver-sms-automation-v2-trigger` targets `naverplace_send_inform_v2` but stays disabled pending the parallel deployment story (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:117-128`, `docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:219-224`).
6. CloudWatch logging for the new function is verified via `aws logs describe-log-groups` or equivalent so future monitoring stories can attach alarms without additional provisioning (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:225-229`, `docs/ops/logging.md:426-433`).

**Quality Requirements**
7. Function metadata (ARN, image digest, role ARN, creation timestamp) is documented in `VALIDATION.md` or linked deployment notes for the Go/No-Go review (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:206-266`).
8. `aws lambda get-function --function-name naverplace_send_inform_v2` output is captured to confirm image, role, timeout, memory, and environment configuration match expectations (`docs/infra/DOCKER_BUILD_AND_DEPLOY.md:300-327`, `docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:212-218`).
9. Secrets access validation passes by assuming the Lambda execution role (or using sts-simulated credentials) and running `scripts/validate_secrets.py`, demonstrating the new function can read required secrets without policy regressions (`docs/infra/secrets-manager.md:59-94`, `docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:212-218`).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Provision `naverplace_send_inform_v2` with the specified container image, timeout, memory, and execution role; record ARN and image digest (AC 1, AC 2, AC 7, AC 8).
  - [ ] Confirm no environment variables were added during creation (`aws lambda get-function` output) to ensure Secrets Manager remains the sole secret source (AC 3, AC 8).
- [ ] Create the disabled EventBridge rule `naver-sms-automation-v2-trigger` pointing at the new function without altering the legacy trigger (AC 4, AC 5).
  - [ ] Store the rule definition and current state (DISABLED) in deployment notes for Story 5.3 hand-off (AC 5, AC 7).
- [ ] Verify CloudWatch log group readiness and role permissions by listing log groups and running `scripts/validate_secrets.py --assume-role-arn <lambda-role-arn>` (AC 6, AC 9).
  - [ ] Document validation outputs in `VALIDATION.md` to satisfy the Epic Go/No-Go evidence requirement (AC 7, AC 9).

## Dev Notes

- **AWS Region & Account:** Use `ap-northeast-2` in account `654654307503`; retain naming conventions `naverplace_send_inform_v2` and `naver-sms-automation-v2-trigger` for consistency with the epic plan (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:105-127`).
- **Execution Role:** Prefer reusing the documented `lambda-execution-role`; if Terraform outputs a different ARN, update references in both the story deliverables and Secrets Manager policies (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:111-112`, `docs/infra/secrets-manager.md:15-48`).
- **Container Image Tagging:** Default to `latest` plus the immutable release tag created in Story 5.1; capture the SHA digest from ECR for the deployment log (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:95-116`, `docs/stories/5.1.deploy-to-ecr.md:1-205`).
- **Trigger Management:** Do not enable the new EventBridge rule until Story 5.3 completes comparison monitoring and receives a green gate from QA (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:117-128`, `docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:219-243`).
- **Validation Artifacts:** Store CLI outputs (function description, rule state, secrets validation) under `VALIDATION.md` with timestamps to streamline the Go/No-Go review (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:206-266`).

### Testing

- Execute `aws lambda get-function --function-name naverplace_send_inform_v2` and attach the sanitized JSON response to the story evidence (AC 1, AC 2, AC 3, AC 8).
- Run `aws events describe-rule --name naver-sms-automation-v2-trigger` to verify the rule exists and remains disabled (AC 5).
- Invoke `scripts/validate_secrets.py --assume-role-arn arn:aws:iam::654654307503:role/lambda-execution-role` (or equivalent) to confirm Secrets Manager access and record the PASS output (AC 3, AC 9).
- Use `aws logs describe-log-groups --log-group-name-prefix /aws/lambda/naverplace_send_inform_v2` to ensure log plumbing is available for subsequent monitoring tasks (AC 6).

- **Secrets Management:** All three credentials (Naver, SENS, Telegram) protected via Secrets Manager resource policies
- **Environment Variables:** Zero configured; secrets accessed only via Secrets Manager API
- **Network:** Lambda function uses default VPC configuration per brownfield-architecture.md:1374-1378
- **Encryption:** All credentials stored with AWS managed encryption

**Verification:** Lambda execution role has explicit permissions for:
- `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` on all three credential secrets
- `secretsmanager:DescribeSecret` for secret metadata
- `dynamodb:*` for booking/session table access
- `logs:CreateLogGroup, logs:CreateLogStream, logs:PutLogEvents` for CloudWatch logging

### Performance Considerations

Lambda configuration aligns with Story 4.5 performance testing results:
- **Timeout:** 300 seconds (well above 4-minute baseline from performance tests)
- **Memory:** 512 MB (above peak usage of 320 MB observed in Story 4.5)
- **Cold-start:** Expected 5-8 seconds (within 10-second NFR threshold)
- **Throughput:** Capable of handling 20-minute event schedule from EventBridge

### Files Modified During Review
