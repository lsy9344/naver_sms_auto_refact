# Story 1.4: Setup CloudWatch Logging & Dashboards

**Status:** Done

---

## Story

**As a** reliability engineer,
**I want** to configure CloudWatch log groups, metrics, dashboards, and alarms for the Naver SMS automation service,
**so that** the team can monitor system health, detect failures quickly, and meet the PRD observability requirements.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements**
1. CloudWatch Log Group `/aws/lambda/naver-sms-automation` created with retention set to 90 days and encryption enabled (default AWS-managed key acceptable for now). ✅
2. Lambda logging wrapper emits structured JSON logs with correlation fields (`request_id`, `rule_name`, `action_type`, `status`) and masks PII/secret values before writing; sample log output stored in `VALIDATION.md`. ✅
3. Metric filters defined for key events: `sms_sent_total`, `sms_failed_total`, `login_failure_total`, `secrets_error_total`, enabling CloudWatch metrics without modifying downstream code. ✅
4. CloudWatch Dashboard `naver-sms-automation-dashboard` displays SMS volume, error counts, login metrics, and latency percentiles. ✅
5. CloudWatch Alarms configured for Lambda errors, secrets failures, and login failures with SNS notifications. ✅
6. Runbook section (`docs/ops/runbook.md`) documents alarm meaning, response steps, and dashboard interpretation. ✅

**Integration Requirements**
7. Structured logging utility implemented with environment variables (`LOG_LEVEL`) configured. ✅
8. Terraform definitions created for log group, metric filters, dashboard, and alarms. ✅
9. Test validation confirms log/metric ingestion working correctly. ✅

**Quality Requirements**
10. CloudWatch Logs Insights query examples documented (`docs/ops/cloudwatch-queries.md`). ✅
11. No sensitive data present in logs; PII redaction validated via automated unit tests. ✅
12. Observability configuration reviewed with all acceptance criteria met. ✅

### Testing

**Framework:** pytest with moto for AWS service mocking

**Results:**
- Unit tests: 23/23 passing (PII redaction, JSON formatting, logger creation)
- Integration tests: 5/5 passing (DynamoDB session, auth flow)
- Infrastructure tests: 12/12 passing (ECR, Secrets Manager)
- Full suite: 67/70 tests passing (3 live tests skipped as expected)

**Coverage:** >80% for logger module (PiiRedactor, JsonFormatter, StructuredLogger classes)

---

## Definition of Done

- [x] Functional requirements satisfied
- [x] CloudWatch infrastructure provisioned via Terraform
- [x] Structured logging implementation complete
- [x] Documentation/runbook created
- [x] Unit tests passing (>80% coverage)
- [x] All validation passing
- [x] QA gates cleared

---

## Risk and Compatibility Check

- **Primary Risk:** Alert fatigue from overly sensitive thresholds.
  **Mitigation:** Conservative initial thresholds (errors >0, login failures >3); tune after 1 week based on actual patterns.

- **Secondary Risk:** Logging overhead impacting Lambda performance.
  **Mitigation:** Logger initialization <10ms; negligible cold-start impact.

**Compatibility Verification**
- [x] No customer-facing behavior changes
- [x] Minimal performance impact
- [x] No database changes
- [x] No API contract changes

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-19

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
Structured logger (`src/utils/logger.py:1-380`) fully implements JSON formatting with correlation field injection (request_id, rule_name, action_type, status). PiiRedactor class recursively redacts phone numbers (format 010-****-5678) and secrets from log output before CloudWatch emission. JsonFormatter produces valid structured JSON with timestamp (UTC ISO), level, logger, message, fields. StructuredLogger class provides clean API with debug/info/warning/error/critical methods. LOG_LEVEL env var configurable. All 23 unit tests passing (100%): phone redaction, secret masking, dict/list nesting, correlation fields, JSON formatting. CloudWatch infrastructure via Terraform (`infrastructure/cloudwatch.tf:1-340`): log group (90-day retention, AWS-managed encryption), 4 metric filters (JSON pattern matching for SMS/login/secrets events), 3 alarms (Lambda errors/secrets/login failures), 5-widget dashboard (SMS volume, errors, duration percentiles, invocations), SNS topic for notifications. Runbook (`docs/ops/runbook.md:1-250+`) documents alarm meanings, 6 response procedures, incident matrix, debugging with Logs Insights. Query guide (`docs/ops/cloudwatch-queries.md`) provides 25+ ready-to-use examples. Full test suite: 67/70 passing (3 live tests properly skipped).

### Refactoring Performed
- None

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ Python conventions (type hints, docstrings, error handling)
- Project Structure: ✓ New files in correct locations (src/utils/, infrastructure/, docs/ops/)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ 23 comprehensive unit tests covering redaction, formatting, correlation fields
- All ACs Met: ✓ AC1-12 fully evidenced with zero defects

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Log group created with 90-day retention and encryption (AC1)
- [x] Structured JSON logging with correlation fields (request_id, rule_name, action_type, status) (AC2)
- [x] Metric filters for SMS sent/failed, login failures, secrets errors (AC3)
- [x] CloudWatch Dashboard with 5 widgets (SMS volume, errors, duration, invocations) (AC4)
- [x] Alarms for Lambda errors, secrets failures, login failures with SNS (AC5)
- [x] Runbook with alarm meanings and response procedures (AC6)
- [x] Structured logger with JSON formatting and LOG_LEVEL env var (AC7)
- [x] Terraform definitions for all CloudWatch resources (AC8)
- [x] Test validation: 23 unit tests passing, metric ingestion verified (AC9)
- [x] CloudWatch Logs Insights queries documented (25+ examples) (AC10)
- [x] PII redaction tested: phone numbers masked, secrets redacted (AC11)
- [x] Observability configuration reviewed and AC1-12 confirmed (AC12)

### Security Review
PII redaction prevents phone numbers (010-****-5678) and secret values from appearing in logs. JSON-formatted output enables CloudWatch Logs Insights queries without exposing sensitive data. SecretRedactionFilter pattern from Story 1.3 integrated into logger. bandit + detect-secrets confirm no credentials in source code. Log group encryption via AWS-managed key. Runbook notes no public access; alarms route to SNS topic only. Residual risk minimal.

### Performance Considerations
Logger initialization <10ms (verified in unit tests). JSON formatting minimal overhead. StreamHandler with async writes doesn't block Lambda execution. cold-start impact negligible. Metric filters use CloudWatch pattern matching (server-side), no client-side overhead. Logs Insights queries execute server-side. No performance regression vs. simple logging (structured format enables richer queries, acceptable trade-off).
