# Story 5.6: Perform Production Cutover

## Status

Ready for Review

---

## Quick Project Assessment

**Current System Context**
- [x] Offline validation and monitoring readiness gates from Stories 5.4 and 5.5 must pass before enabling any production traffic (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:260-275`).
- [x] EventBridge schedule remains disabled until go/no-go approval authorizes the cutover (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:116-149`).
- [x] Rollback relies on fast EventBridge rule disablement and container rollback because the legacy Lambda is decommissioned (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:286-336`).
- [x] Success criteria demand zero customer-facing disruption and instant monitoring visibility once traffic moves to the new Lambda (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:207-235`).

**Change Scope**
- [ ] Conduct the cutover readiness review, capture approvals, and confirm validation evidence completeness (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:260-275`).
- [ ] Enable the production EventBridge rule, observe first invocation, and verify downstream integrations succeed (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:116-149`).
- [ ] Execute immediate post-cutover health checks and alarm drills to ensure monitoring, notifications, and rollback paths behave as expected (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:297-336`).
- [ ] Document actions, timestamps, and evidence in `VALIDATION.md` and the deployment runbook for hand-off to post-cutover monitoring (Story 5.7) (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:231-235`).

## Story

**As a** release captain overseeing the migration,  
**I want** to perform the production cutover by enabling the new container-based Lambda and validating its first live executions,  
**so that** customer notifications continue without interruption and stakeholders have auditable proof the go-live succeeded.

---

## Story Context

- Go/no-go checkpoint #2 requires recorded approval and validation evidence before traffic moves to the new Lambda (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:260-275`).
- EventBridge scheduling must be toggled from `DISABLED` to `ENABLED` only after confirming prerequisites and communicating the cutover window (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:116-149`).
- Monitoring dashboards, alarms, and Telegram alerts must be active to detect issues within the <10 minute detection SLA defined for rollback procedures (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:297-336`).
- Rollback SLA mandates disabling the EventBridge rule and redeploying the previous container (if needed) within 35 minutes if critical issues appear (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:314-336`).
- Evidence from the cutover phase feeds post-cutover monitoring (Story 5.7) and final epic close-out documentation (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:231-235`).

---

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements**
1. Go/no-go meeting minutes, stakeholder approvals, and validation evidence summary are recorded prior to enabling production traffic, referencing `VALIDATION.md` and readiness reports (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:260-275`).
2. EventBridge rule `naver-sms-automation-trigger` is enabled with documented command output, and the first scheduled Lambda execution completes successfully with DynamoDB writes, SENS SMS dispatch, and Telegram notification confirmation logs (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:116-149`, `docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:207-214`).
3. No customer-impacting discrepancies are detected during or immediately after the first execution, confirmed via CloudWatch metrics, SENS delivery stats, and comparison telemetry (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:207-235`).

**Integration Requirements**
4. CloudWatch dashboard widgets and alarms remain in healthy states (no triggered alarms beyond informational), with screenshots or exports captured as evidence of monitoring readiness (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:297-322`).
5. Telegram alerting channel receives cutover start, success, and escalation notifications, and contact escalation paths are confirmed (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:321-349`).
6. Rollback drill confirming EventBridge disablement and previous container redeploy instructions is executed or dry-run validated within the defined <35 minute end-to-end SLA (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:314-336`).

**Quality Requirements**
7. `VALIDATION.md` gains a cutover section with timestamps, AWS command transcripts, alarm states, and approval artifacts complying with audit expectations (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:231-235`).
8. `docs/ops/runbook.md` is updated with production cutover steps, communication templates, and rollback escalation contacts aligned to the new container deployment (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:314-336`, `docs/ops/runbook.md:1`).
9. Risk log or decision register captures any deviations, mitigations, and lessons learned to inform Story 5.7 monitoring activities (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:336-352`).

## Dev Notes

- **Cutover Prerequisites:** Confirm Stories 5.4 and 5.5 evidence is marked complete in `VALIDATION.md` and readiness checklists are green before proceeding (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:260-275`, `VALIDATION.md`).
- **EventBridge Control:** Production schedule is `naver-sms-automation-trigger`. Use the AWS CLI from release workstation:
  ```bash
  aws events enable-rule --name naver-sms-automation-trigger --region ap-northeast-2
  aws events disable-rule --name naver-sms-automation-trigger --region ap-northeast-2  # rollback drill
  aws lambda invoke \
    --function-name naverplace_send_inform_v2 \
    --invocation-type RequestResponse \
    --log-type Tail \
    --payload '{\"dry_run\": false}' \
    out/first-cutover-response.json \
    --region ap-northeast-2
  ```
  Capture command output as `docs/validation/story-5.6/eventbridge-enable.txt` and `eventbridge-disable.txt` for audit (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:116-149`).
- **Monitoring Evidence:** Export CloudWatch dashboard widgets (`naver-sms-automation-dashboard`) before and after cutover as PNGs and store inside `docs/validation/story-5.6/` with filenames `dashboard-pre-cutover.png` and `dashboard-post-cutover.png` (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:297-322`, `docs/ops/runbook.md:1-58`).
- **Notification Flow:** Follow the escalation playbook in `docs/ops/runbook.md:69-116` and `docs/ops/runbook.md:390-404`. Send three Telegram messages (start, success, escalation test) and confirm escalation contact acknowledges in Slack `#alerts`. Record screenshots or message IDs in `docs/validation/story-5.6/notifications.md` (AC5).
- **Documentation Targets:** Append a new section titled `## Validation Evidence: Story 5.6 - Production Cutover` near the top of `VALIDATION.md` with timestamps, CLI transcripts, dashboard exports, and approval summaries. Update `docs/ops/runbook.md` by adding/refreshing the “Production Cutover Procedure” subsection under the Maintenance section with the precise steps executed (`docs/ops/runbook.md:320-404`).
- **Risk & Decision Logging:** Add cutover deviations or mitigations to the “Risks & Mitigation” table inside `docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md` (update or append rows) and, if decisions arise, capture them in the “Go/No-Go Decision Points” notes for traceability (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:352-390`).
- **Rollback Readiness:** Previous container image digest is recorded in Story 5.1 (`docs/stories/5.1.deploy-to-ecr.md:144-189`). Be prepared to retag and redeploy it if rollback triggered; document the dry-run timing in `docs/validation/story-5.6/rollback-drill.txt`.

### Testing

- **Observability Checks:** Use CloudWatch dashboards and alarm histories to confirm metrics and thresholds remained healthy across the cutover window (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:297-322`).
- **Functional Spot Checks:** Trigger manual booking scenarios (if feasible) or review SENS/Telia logs to ensure real customer flows succeeded post-cutover (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:207-235`).
- **Rollback Tabletop:** Simulate disabling EventBridge and redeploying previous image, capturing elapsed time to ensure SLA adherence (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:314-336`).
- **Audit Evidence:** Preserve CLI transcripts, screenshots, and approval artifacts within `docs/validation/story-5.6/` and summarize them in `VALIDATION.md` for QA gate review and compliance (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:231-235`).

## Open Questions

1. Do additional stakeholder communication channels (e.g., Slack, email) need explicit message templates alongside Telegram alerts during cutover? (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:321-349`)
2. Can the rollback drill be executed in production during the cutover window, or should it be validated in staging with documented equivalency? (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:314-336`)
3. Are there any regulatory or audit notifications required to confirm the SMS service migration when traffic moves to the new Lambda? (`docs/epics/epic-5-deployment.md:231-235`)

### Review Date: 2025-10-23

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Requirements Traceability
- **AC1** – *Given* the go/no-go checklist must be complete, *when* reviewing the approvals block in `VALIDATION.md` (`VALIDATION.md:2869`), *then* stakeholder sign-offs are present and traceable.
- **AC2** – *Given* audited enablement output is required, *when* reading `docs/validation/story-5.6/eventbridge-enable.txt:26`, *then* the captured "Actual Output" contradicts AWS CLI behavior (should be empty), so evidence is invalid and AC2 is not yet satisfied.
- **AC3** – *Given* we need proof of error-free execution, *when* reviewing `docs/validation/story-5.6/first-run-summary.md`, *then* telemetry shows 20/20 SMS success with no discrepancies.
- **AC4** – *Given* screenshots/exports must be archived, *when* listing `docs/validation/story-5.6/`, *then* no dashboard PNG/CSV assets exist, so AC4 lacks verifiable evidence.
- **AC5** – *Given* notifications must be auditable, *when* reviewing `docs/validation/story-5.6/notifications.md`, *then* Telegram and Slack message IDs plus acknowledgements are recorded.
- **AC6** – *Given* rollback must be validated, *when* reading `docs/validation/story-5.6/rollback-drill.txt` and `docs/validation/story-5.6/eventbridge-disable.txt`, *then* the tabletop drill meets the <35 minute SLA with confirmatory timestamps.
- **AC7** – *Given* VALIDATION content must be updated, *when* checking `VALIDATION.md:2819`, *then* a Story 5.6 section exists with timeline and approvals.
- **AC8** – *Given* the runbook must reflect reality, *when* inspecting `docs/ops/runbook.md:722-731`, *then* the "Expected output" text still promises JSON fields the CLI never returns, so the document is inaccurate.
- **AC9** – *Given* risks should be logged, *when* reviewing the Story 5.6 summary (`VALIDATION.md:3236`), *then* risk level is recorded as LOW with no deviations.

### Code Quality Assessment
Documentation and evidence are generally thorough, but two high-severity audit gaps block acceptance: the enablement transcript misrepresents AWS CLI output, and required CloudWatch dashboard exports were not captured. These undermine auditability of the cutover and monitoring verification. Runbook guidance also perpetuates the incorrect CLI expectation.

### Refactoring Performed
- None (documentation-only review).

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✗ – Runbook instructions (`docs/ops/runbook.md:722-731`) describe an impossible CLI response and must be corrected to match AWS documentation.
- Project Structure: ✓ – Evidence artifacts are stored under the prescribed `docs/validation/story-5.6/` subtree.
- Testing Strategy: ✓ – Functional and rollback validations are documented with clear pass/fail criteria.
- All ACs Met: ✗ – AC2 and AC4 remain unmet until evidence is corrected and dashboard exports are archived.

### Improvements Checklist
- [ ] Replace the inaccurate `aws events enable-rule` "Actual Output" in `docs/validation/story-5.6/eventbridge-enable.txt` with the real (empty) CLI response and add the subsequent `describe-rule` JSON as proof of the enabled state.
- [ ] Export and commit the required CloudWatch dashboard/alarm evidence (e.g., `dashboard-pre-cutover.png`, `dashboard-post-cutover.png`) under `docs/validation/story-5.6/` as mandated by Dev Notes and AC4.
- [ ] Update `docs/ops/runbook.md` Production Cutover procedure to state that `enable-rule` returns no body and to instruct capturing the `describe-rule` verification output instead.
- [ ] (Optional) Note latency and alarm snapshots in VALIDATION.md once screenshots are added to improve traceability.

### Security Review
No new security regressions detected; primary concerns are evidentiary accuracy rather than control weakness.

### Performance Considerations
Recorded metrics meet thresholds; no additional performance risks identified.

### Files Modified During Review
- None (findings only).

### Gate Status
Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/5.6-perform-production-cutover.yml  
Rationale: Audit evidence for AC2/AC4 is incomplete or incorrect; runbook guidance must be aligned with CLI behavior.

### Recommended Status
✗ Changes Required – Resolve unchecked items above and re-submit evidence for QA validation.
