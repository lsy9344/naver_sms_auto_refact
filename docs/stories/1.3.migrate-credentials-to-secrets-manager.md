# Story 1.3: Migrate Credentials to Secrets Manager

**Status:** Done

---

## Story

**As a** security-focused developer,  
**I want** to remove all hardcoded credentials from the codebase and store them in AWS Secrets Manager,  
**so that** the refactored system complies with security requirements and prevents credential leakage.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements**
1. All credentials called out in the PRD and architecture review (Naver login, SENS API keys, Telegram bot token/chat ID) are deleted from source files (`original_code/lambda_function.py`, `original_code/sens_sms.py`, commit history reviewed) and replaced with configuration loader lookups wired to Secrets Manager.
2. Application configuration modules (`src/config/settings.py` and any interim bootstrap code) successfully fetch the new secrets using `boto3.client('secretsmanager')` with names established in Story 1.2, and raise a descriptive error if missing.
3. Environment bootstrap script (`scripts/bootstrap_env.sh`) documents the minimal IAM permissions required (`secretsmanager:GetSecretValue`, `kms:Decrypt` if default key) and confirm credentials are never echoed or logged.

**Integration Requirements**
4. Lambda container entrypoint (`src/main.py` placeholder) reads secrets during cold start and caches them; no secret values are written to CloudWatch Logs (verified via structured logging redaction helper).
5. Local development guide (`docs/dev/local-setup.md`) explains how engineers fetch temporary credentials via AWS CLI profiles without copying values into source files.
6. Existing unit/integration tests that relied on hardcoded credentials are updated to use dependency injection or fixtures (e.g., `tests/integration/test_naver_auth_live.py`) so test suites run with mock secrets or skip when secrets unavailable.

**Quality Requirements**
7. Static analysis/security scanning (`bandit`, `detect-secrets`, or project-equivalent) runs clean with no hardcoded credential findings; evidence attached to `VALIDATION.md`.
8. Code review checklist (`docs/QA/code-review-checklist.md`) updated to include "Secrets retrieved from Secrets Manager" gate.
9. Git history scrub completed for sensitive values (BFG or `git filter-repo`) with documented steps and confirmation that public history no longer contains the credentials, or risk accepted and tracked if not feasible.

## Dev Notes

- **References:**
  - Hardcoded credential analysis in `docs/brownfield-architecture.md:686-710, 1860-1870`.
  - PRD security requirements (`docs/prd.md:134-160, 224-270`).
  - Story 1.2 secret names and schemas (`docs/stories/1.2.setup-secrets-manager.md`).
- **Implementation Guidance:**
  - Use boto3 Secrets Manager client with exponential backoff for retrieval.
  - Leverage `functools.lru_cache` or module-level caching to avoid repeated calls.
  - Ensure secrets are decrypted using default AWS-managed KMS key unless custom key defined later.
  - Redaction helper should replace any substring matching secret values with `***REDACTED***` in structured log output.
  - Consider using custom `logging.Filter` or formatter to intercept log records before CloudWatch emission.
- **Relevant Source Tree:**
  ```
  src/
  ├── config/
  │   ├── __init__.py
  │   └── settings.py          ← Configuration loader (update here)
  ├── main.py                   ← Lambda entrypoint (reads secrets on cold start)

  ```

### Testing

**Test Framework:** pytest (per Story 1.2 pattern)
**Test Location:**
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_naver_auth.py`, `tests/unit/test_config.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_naver_auth_live.py`

**Test Standards:**
- Unit test coverage target: >80% (per `brownfield-architecture.md:1620`)
- Use fixtures for mock secrets (moto for AWS Secrets Manager mocking)
- Integration tests should skip cleanly when AWS credentials unavailable (`@pytest.mark.skipif`)
- Security: Run `bandit` and `detect-secrets` in CI pipeline

**Mocking Strategy:**
- AWS services: Use `moto` library for Secrets Manager mocking (per Story 1.2 pattern)
- Local secrets: Use `unittest.mock.patch` for environment variable overrides
- Fixture example (`conftest.py`):
  ```python
  @pytest.fixture
  def mock_secrets():
      return {
          'naver-sms-automation/naver-credentials': {'username': 'test_user', 'password': 'test_pass'},
          'naver-sms-automation/sens-credentials': {'access_key': 'test_key', 'secret_key': 'test_secret', 'service_id': 'test_svc'},
          'naver-sms-automation/telegram-credentials': {'bot_token': 'test_token', 'chat_id': 'test_chat'}
      }
  ```

**Story-Specific Requirements:**
- Add unit tests for redaction helper that strips secret substrings from log output
- Update `tests/integration/test_naver_auth_live.py` to use fixtures instead of hardcoded credentials
- Validation: Evidence of clean security scans captured in `VALIDATION.md`
- Test environment variable override: Introduce `USE_LOCAL_SECRETS_FILE` for offline development with dummy JSON

## Definition of Done

- [x] Functional requirements met  
- [x] Integration requirements verified  
- [x] Security scans and tests pass  
- [x] Documentation updated  
- [x] Evidence logged in `VALIDATION.md`

---

## Risk and Compatibility Check

- **Primary Risk:** Missing secret retrieval causing runtime failure.  
  **Mitigation:** Fallback validation script before deployment; CloudWatch alarm for secret access errors.

- **Rollback Plan:** Reintroduce temporary environment variables for secrets (short-term) and redeploy previous container image while investigating.

**Compatibility Verification**
- [x] No API changes visible to consumers  
- [x] Database unchanged  
- [x] UI unaffected  
- [x] Performance impact minimal (single cold-start fetch)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-19

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
Configuration loader (`src/config/settings.py:1-390`) fully implements Secrets Manager integration with exponential backoff retry logic (3 attempts: 1s, 2s, 4s delays). Secret redaction filter (`SecretRedactionFilter` class) recursively extracts and masks secret values before CloudWatch emission. Bootstrap script validates AWS CLI, credentials, Secrets Manager access, and secret schemas. Module-level convenience functions simplify credential access. All 24 unit tests passing via moto-backed AWS mocking; 8 integration tests passing with 3 live tests properly skipped. Security scans clean: bandit (0 issues, 3 false positives suppressed via #nosec B105), detect-secrets (0 credential leaks across 27 plugins).

### Refactoring Performed
- None

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ Python conventions followed (type hints, docstrings, error handling)
- Project Structure: ✓ Files in correct directories (src/config/, scripts/, tests/, docs/)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ 32 tests covering redaction, retry logic, error cases, local file fallback
- All ACs Met: ✓ AC1-8 fully evidenced; AC9 (git history scrub) risk accepted—legacy code in `original_code/` isolated; refactored code has no hardcoded credentials

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Configuration loader fetches all three credential types (Naver, SENS, Telegram)
- [x] Exponential backoff + error handling for transient/permanent failures
- [x] Secret redaction filter prevents CloudWatch leakage
- [x] Bootstrap script validates AWS setup and documents IAM policy
- [x] Local setup guide covers AWS CLI profile configuration
- [x] Tests use moto for Secrets Manager mocking (no real AWS calls needed)
- [x] Security scans (bandit, detect-secrets) pass cleanly
- [x] Code review checklist (docs/QA/code-review-checklist.md) includes 9 Story 1.3 gates
- [x] Git history decision: risk accepted per team; legacy code reference only

### Security Review
Secret redaction filter ensures no credential values appear in CloudWatch Logs. Exponential backoff with descriptive error messages prevents API throttling and aids debugging. Secrets Manager resource policies (from Story 1.2) enforce least-privilege access. Local fallback (`USE_LOCAL_SECRETS_FILE`) requires explicit env var—defaults to AWS. Bandit + detect-secrets confirm no credentials in source code. Residual risk minimal.

### Performance Considerations
Secrets fetched once on Lambda cold start via boto3 Secrets Manager client; cached for container lifetime. Exponential backoff (max 7 seconds total: 1+2+4) acceptable for cold start (Lambda cold starts typically 200-500ms for Python). LOCAL_SECRETS_FILE env var enables fast testing without AWS API calls. No performance regression vs. hardcoded credentials (single network call vs. zero, acceptable trade-off for security).
