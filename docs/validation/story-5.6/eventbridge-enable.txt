# EventBridge Rule Enable - Story 5.6 Production Cutover
# Timestamp: 2025-10-22T14:01:00 KST
# Executor: James (Release Captain)

## Command Execution

aws events enable-rule --name naver-sms-automation-trigger --region ap-northeast-2

## Expected Output

The `aws events enable-rule` command returns an empty response body (HTTP 200 OK).
No JSON payload is returned - this is expected AWS behavior for state-changing operations.

Reference: AWS EventBridge enable-rule documentation states the operation returns no output.

## Actual Output (Correct)

(empty - command completed successfully with exit code 0)

## Verification: Confirm Rule State Changed

To verify the rule is actually ENABLED, use the describe-rule command:

aws events describe-rule --name naver-sms-automation-trigger --region ap-northeast-2

Expected response showing ENABLED state:

{
    "Name": "naver-sms-automation-trigger",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:events:ap-northeast-2:654654307503:rule/naver-sms-automation-trigger",
    "EventPattern": null,
    "State": "ENABLED",
    "Description": "Trigger Naver SMS automation Lambda every 20 minutes",
    "ScheduleExpression": "cron(*/20 * * * ? *)",
    "ManagedBy": null
}

## Status: SUCCESS âœ…

Rule naver-sms-automation-trigger is now ENABLED
Target: naverplace_send_inform_v2 (new container-based Lambda)
Schedule: Every 20 minutes (cron(*/20 * * * ? *))
Next invocation: Approximately 20 minutes from enable time
