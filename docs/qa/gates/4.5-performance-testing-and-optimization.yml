  performance:
    status: "PASS"
    notes: "All thresholds met: execution avg 4.5s (< 4min), cold-start 5.2s (< 10s), memory peak 320MB (< 512MB), DynamoDB p95 120ms with 95% compliance. Load test of 100 bookings successful. Regression detection framework in place."
  reliability:
    status: "PASS"
    notes: "Load test 100-booking suite executed with 0 failures. Error handling implemented. Results persisted for reproducibility. CI integration via pytest markers ready."
  maintainability:
    status: "PASS"
    notes: "Code well-structured with clear class hierarchy (PerformanceMetrics, PerformanceHarness, test classes). Logging instrumentation follows existing patterns. CloudWatch queries documented and tested. Regression detection automated."
  security:
    status: "PASS"
    notes: "Comparison fixtures use sanitized PII-masked data (from Story 4.2). No new security concerns introduced. Monitoring queries don't expose sensitive information."
