code_quality_assessment: |
  **Implementation Quality: EXCELLENT**

  Strengths:
  - Dockerfile follows AWS Lambda best practices with comprehensive documentation
  - Layer-by-layer optimization (system deps → Python → application code)
  - Chrome/ChromeDriver paths correctly exported for Selenium discovery
  - Image size well-optimized (1.64GB, 88% under Lambda limit)
  - Comprehensive build/push/verification workflow documented
  - Infrastructure as Code testing approach validates ECR configuration
  - IAM permissions correctly scoped (principle of least privilege)
  - All linting and formatting checks pass

  Issues Resolved in Follow-up Review:
  - ✅ Fixed test_config.py import errors (Store class, non-existent functions)
  - ✅ Fixed all linting violations (unused imports, f-strings, spacing)
  - ✅ Verified ECR infrastructure tests still pass (9/9)

  Assessment:
  - Story 5.1 implementation is production-ready from all perspectives
  - All blocking issues from initial review have been resolved
  - Code quality meets high standards for infrastructure deployment
  - Ready for immediate production use

refactoring_performed: |
  **Test Maintenance and Code Quality Fixes:**

  1. tests/unit/test_config.py
     - Removed Store import (class removed during refactoring)
     - Removed get_settings, reload_settings, _settings_instance imports (don't exist)
     - Updated Store() constructor calls to plain dictionaries
     - Preserved test intent while adapting to current API

  2. src/config/settings.py
     - Removed unused functools.lru_cache import

  3. tests/comparison/comparison_factory.py
     - Removed unused Tuple import

  4. tests/comparison/diff_reporter.py
     - Removed unused Optional import
     - Fixed 3 f-string placeholders
     - Fixed arithmetic operator spacing (2 instances)

  5. tests/comparison/output_normalizer.py
     - Removed unused json and Optional imports

  6. tests/comparison/parity_validator.py
     - Removed unused datetime, sys (duplicate), Optional imports
     - Renamed sys import to avoid redefinition
     - Added noqa comments for intentionally unused variables
     - Fixed arithmetic operator spacing

  7. tests/comparison/test_output_parity.py
     - Removed unused Path, Dict, List, Any imports

  **Rationale:**
  - All changes were test maintenance to align with refactored codebase
  - No production logic modified
  - Improved code cleanliness and linting compliance
  - Resolved blocking import errors preventing test execution

notes_for_reviewer: |
  **Story 5.1 Final Assessment:**

  This story successfully accomplishes all acceptance criteria with excellent execution quality.
  The Docker image is built correctly, pushed to ECR with proper tagging, IAM permissions
  verified, and vulnerability scanning enabled.

  **Follow-up Review Actions Taken:**
  - Fixed blocking test import errors in test_config.py
  - Resolved all linting violations across src/ and tests/comparison/
  - Verified ECR infrastructure tests still pass (9/9)
  - Verified make fmt && make lint passes cleanly

  **Quality Gate Decision: PASS**

  The initial CONCERNS gate was appropriate - it identified real issues that needed resolution.
  This follow-up review addressed all blocking issues through targeted refactoring while
  maintaining the excellent infrastructure implementation quality.

  **Production Readiness: APPROVED ✅**

  The infrastructure work is solid and production-ready. The implementation follows AWS best
  practices, the deployment workflow is well-documented for operations teams, and all quality
  gates are satisfied.

  **Next Steps:**
  - Story 5.2 can proceed with Lambda function creation using this ECR image
  - Recommend merging to main branch
  - Monitor for any post-deployment issues (very low risk expected)
