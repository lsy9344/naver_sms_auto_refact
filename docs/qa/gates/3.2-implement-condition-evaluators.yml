story_title: "Implement Condition Evaluators"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "Story 3.2 successfully implements 6 condition evaluators that faithfully replicate legacy SMS automation logic. All 12 acceptance criteria met. Excellent test coverage (91%), immutability guaranteed, proper error handling throughout. Ready for integration with action executors and rule configuration."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Pure functions prevent state manipulation, no DynamoDB writes, no credential exposure, input validation on all parameters, exception handling prevents information leakage."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Pure in-memory evaluations (<1ms per evaluator), early exit optimization, no external calls. Requirement <100ms per rule significantly exceeded."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Graceful error handling on all missing inputs, exception handling for all edge cases, immutability guarantees deterministic behavior, comprehensive test coverage."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Pure function design is self-documenting, comprehensive docstrings with legacy references, registry pattern for clean composition, flexible option format handling."
