story_title: 'Validate New Lambda Readiness'
gate: FAIL
status_reason: |
  2025-10-21 re-review shows Story 5.5 remains blocked. The newly added "automation" exists
  only as self-contained test fixtures that never exercise production code, and the suites
  themselves fail (coverage gate + assertions). No validation campaign has been executed,
  acceptance criteria 1-9 remain unmet, and the readiness decision is still manual.

    severity: critical
    title: 'End-to-End Validation Workflow Not Implemented'
    description: |
      `tests/integration/test_validation_campaign.py` defines a fake `ValidationEnvironment`
      and campaign workflow entirely inside the test file. No production orchestration exists
      and the test never touches `scripts/bootstrap_validation_campaign.py` or the Lambda
      entrypoints. AC1/AC3/AC5 remain unimplemented. Regression run fails immediately when
      executed with project coverage settings.

      - scripts/bootstrap_validation_campaign.py:17
      - docs/stories/5.5.validate-new-lambda-readiness.md:80
    remediation: |
      Move the workflow code into `src/validation`, wire it to real bootstrap/comparison logic,
      and execute against recorded fixtures. Replace in-test classes with imports from the
      production package and ensure pytest passes under the repo's coverage thresholds.

  - id: 'OPS-001'
    severity: critical
    title: 'Readiness Gate Automation Missing'
    description: |
      The supposed readiness validator lives only inside
      `tests/integration/test_readiness_gate.py`. It fabricates its own dataclasses and never
      integrates with comparison metrics, CloudWatch exports, or Slack telemetry. Running the
      test fails the repo-wide coverage requirement, confirming the automation is non-functional.
      AC9 is still 0% complete.
    suggested_owner: 'dev'
    refs:
      - tests/integration/test_readiness_gate.py:18
      - docs/stories/5.5.validate-new-lambda-readiness.md:146
      - VALIDATION.md:2241
    remediation: |
      Implement a real readiness validator under `src/validation/` that consumes campaign outputs,
      emits a JSON report, and updates VALIDATION.md. Update the tests to import that module and
      make them pass with coverage enabled.

  - id: 'BUS-001'
    severity: critical
    title: 'Evidence Packaging Automation Failing'
    description: |
      `tests/integration/test_evidence_packaging.py` introduces another in-test implementation of
      an EvidencePackager. The integration case fails (`AssertionError: 'test_report' in content`)
      and the coverage gate aborts the run. No automation updates VALIDATION.md; AC2/AC6/AC8 remain
      unmet with placeholder copy only (`VALIDATION.md:2241-2259`).
    suggested_owner: 'dev'
    refs:
      - tests/integration/test_evidence_packaging.py:18
      - VALIDATION.md:2241
      - docs/stories/5.5.validate-new-lambda-readiness.md:100
    remediation: |
      Deliver a concrete evidence packaging pipeline (scripts + library) that ingests campaign
      artifacts, updates VALIDATION.md, and provide green integration tests that reference it.

  - id: 'SEC-001'
    severity: high
    title: 'COMPARISON_MODE Enforcement Untested'
    description: |
      The new "kill switch" coverage lives only in `tests/unit/test_comparison_mode.py`, which
      defines its own stub service instead of exercising `src/config/settings.py` or the Lambda
      handler. Production code still uses `.lower() == "true"` and no automated check prevents SMS
      sends in comparison mode.
    suggested_owner: 'dev'
    refs:
      - tests/unit/test_comparison_mode.py:20
      - src/config/settings.py:45
      - docs/stories/5.5.validate-new-lambda-readiness.md:206
    remediation: |
      Add integration coverage that boots the real handler with COMPARISON_MODE_ENABLED=true,
      verifies no SMS leaves `src/notifications/sms_service.py`, and align env parsing with the
      documented requirements.

  - id: 'PERF-001'
    severity: high
    title: 'Performance Simulation Failing'
    description: |
      `tests/integration/test_campaign_performance.py` fails multiple assertions (threshold checks,
      linear scaling) and aborts after 10 seconds. No actionable performance profile exists for the
      validation campaign.
    suggested_owner: 'dev'
    refs:
      - tests/integration/test_campaign_performance.py:170
      - docs/stories/5.5.validate-new-lambda-readiness.md:119
    remediation: |
      Replace synthetic calculations with measurements from the real comparison runner, adjust
      thresholds to PRD values, and ensure the suite completes under coverage gating.

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: FAIL
    notes: |
      No automated enforcement of COMPARISON_MODE. Tests exercise only stubs and do not touch the
      handler. Risk of accidental live SMS during validation persists.
  performance:
    status: FAIL
    notes: |
      Performance suite fails and produces no actionable metrics. No evidence for 4-minute / 10s
      thresholds. Campaign scalability unknown.
  reliability:
    status: FAIL
    notes: |
      Coverage gating failures prevent running the validation suite. No end-to-end campaign run, no
      alarm response rehearsal, and no readiness report.
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: |
      Automation lives inside tests, bootstrap script imports from `tests/` namespace. Lacks clear
      separation between production utilities and QA tooling.

code_quality_assessment: |
  Component code quality remains solid (SlackWebhookClient, diff tooling, Terraform modules) but
  none of the new Story 5.5 automation is in production modules. Test suites fabricate their own
  implementations, leading to green tests that provide no assurance—and now they are red due to
  assertion bugs and coverage gating. The bootstrap script importing from `tests/` indicates the
  design has not been productised.

files_modified_during_review: []

next_steps: |
  1. Promote automation into src/validation and ensure pytest succeeds with coverage ≥80%.
  2. Run a real validation campaign, capture metrics, alarms, and Slack history.
  3. Update VALIDATION.md with evidence, dashboard exports, and readiness decision artefacts.
  4. Re-submit QA gate once AC1-9 have verifiable proof and all new tests pass.

gate_decision_rationale: |
  The story regressed from CONCERNS to FAIL. Critical automation remains missing, new tests fail,
  and acceptance criteria lack evidence. Until a real campaign is executed and automation is
  delivered in production modules with passing tests, the story cannot proceed toward cutover.
