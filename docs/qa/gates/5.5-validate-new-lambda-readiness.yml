gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: |
  Strong component implementation (Slack service, validation environment, comparison tooling, CloudWatch infrastructure) with 44% full test coverage. However, critical gaps in end-to-end integration testing and zero automation for the final readiness gate decision (AC9) create execution risk. Story is ready for first validation campaign with mitigations in place.

    severity: critical
    title: 'Missing End-to-End Campaign Integration Tests'
    description: |
      No integration test validates complete validation campaign workflow (bootstrap → comparison → reporting → success validation). Individual components unit-tested but integration points untested. Campaign could fail at integration boundaries not caught by isolated tests.
    suggested_owner: 'dev'
    remediation: |
      Create tests/integration/test_validation_campaign.py with full workflow test including bootstrap execution, comparison suite run, CloudWatch metric publishing verification, Slack notification validation, and artifact generation.

    severity: critical
    title: 'Automated Readiness Decision Gate Missing (AC9)'
    description: |
      AC9 requires "final readiness report confirms MSC1 is satisfied" but implementation is completely manual. No automated validation of 100% parity, no success criteria checker, no go/no-go automation. Manual review prone to error and creates single point of failure.
    suggested_owner: 'dev'
    remediation: |
      Create automated readiness validator (tests/integration/test_readiness_gate.py) that validates 100% parity across all channels, confirms zero critical mismatches, generates MSC1 compliance report, and produces go/no-go recommendation.

    severity: critical
    title: 'Incomplete Evidence Package Could Block Cutover'
    description: |
      AC6 requires evidence "appended to VALIDATION.md and linked for readiness review" but process is manual with no automation. Missing/incomplete artifacts discovered during review would delay cutover. Audit trail incompleteness risks approval denial.
    suggested_owner: 'dev'
    remediation: |
      Implement automated evidence packager that collects test reports, exports CloudWatch metrics, extracts alarm logs, gathers Slack history, validates completeness, auto-updates VALIDATION.md with links, and generates manifest.

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: |
      COMPARISON_MODE kill switch mentioned but not explicitly tested in handler. No test validates flag prevents production SMS. Recommended: Add unit + integration test confirming mode enforcement. PII masking well-tested (✅).
  
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: |
      Performance thresholds defined (4min exec, 10s cold start) but no test validates campaign completes within budgets at scale. CloudWatch metric publishing throughput untested. No performance profile for 100+ booking campaigns. Recommended: Add scaling tests (10/50/100/200 bookings).
  
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: |
      Component retry logic good (Slack 3 retries, CloudWatch batching). But: No integration test of full failure recovery. Partial campaign failure scenarios undefined (if one booking fails, does campaign continue?). Recommended: Document and test failure recovery policy.
  
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Runbook (docs/ops/runbook.md) comprehensive with 10 CloudWatch queries. Bootstrap script documented. Slack/validation setup clear. Code is clean and well-structured. Evidence: docs/ops/runbook.md sections 4-6, docs/ops/cloudwatch-queries.md complete.

code_quality_assessment: |
  **Strengths**:
  - SlackWebhookClient well-designed with exponential backoff and non-blocking error handling
  - ValidationEnvironmentConfig comprehensive with 30+ parameters and good defaults
  - DiffReporter produces clean JSON + Markdown artifacts with proper categorization
  - ComparisonLogger/MetricsPublisher have good separation of concerns and error isolation
  - Test suite for comparison scenarios (12 test cases) covers major flows
  - CloudWatch infrastructure well-structured in Terraform with clear metric definitions
  - Documentation (runbook, CloudWatch queries) comprehensive and clear
  
  **Gaps**:
  - No integration test connecting all components (bootstrap → comparison → metrics → reporting)
  - Bootstrap script orchestration not tested (could fail at integration points)
  - Success criteria validation completely manual (AC9)
  - Evidence packaging manual (BUS-001)
  - COMPARISON_MODE enforcement not explicit in handler (SEC-001)
  - No performance profile under load (PERF-001)
  
  **Architecture Observations**:
  - Clean separation between SlackWebhookClient and comparison logic (good design)
  - ComparisonLogger integration point in Lambda handler unclear (document this)
  - Monitoring module (src/monitoring/comparison.py) well-designed but limited E2E testing
  - Diff reporter categorization logic robust and well-organized
  - Config validation exists but not tested (recommend adding)

next_steps: |
  **Before Story Sign-Off**:
  1. Implement TECH-001, OPS-001, BUS-001, SEC-001, PERF-001 mitigations
  2. Create integration tests and verify they pass
  3. Generate automated readiness report
  4. Re-score gate to PASS
  
  **For First Validation Campaign**:
  1. Bootstrap script runs successfully
  2. Comparison suite executes without manual intervention
  3. CloudWatch metrics appear on dashboard
  4. Slack notifications deliver correctly
  5. Evidence package automatically generated in VALIDATION.md
  6. Readiness validator produces go/no-go recommendation
  
  **Post-Campaign**:
  1. Implement remaining MEDIUM/HIGH risk mitigations
  2. Document lessons learned
  3. Update runbook with actual procedures used
  4. Prepare cutover playbook with rollback procedures

gate_decision_rationale: |
  **Why CONCERNS (not PASS or FAIL)**:
  
  ✅ **PASS Factors**:
  - Individual components are well-implemented and unit-tested
  - 44% of ACs have full coverage (AC4: dashboards, AC7: runbook)
  - SlackWebhookClient has solid design with retry logic
  - CloudWatch infrastructure deployed and configured
  - Comparison diff reporting comprehensive
  - Runbook and ops procedures documented
  
  ⚠️ **CONCERNS Factors**:
  - Two CRITICAL gaps (TECH-001, OPS-001) prevent automated confidence in success
  - End-to-end campaign workflow never tested as integrated system
  - Go/no-go decision gate (AC9) is completely manual with no automation
  - Evidence package compilation manual (BUS-001)
  - Performance at scale untested (PERF-001)
  - Comparison mode kill switch not explicitly tested (SEC-001)
  
  ❌ **Why not FAIL**:
  - All critical issues have clear, achievable mitigations
  - Individual components pass their tests
  - CloudWatch and Slack infrastructure already deployed
  - No blocker to first validation campaign (can run with documented procedures)
  - Risks are manageable with integration testing and automation
  
  **Overall Assessment**:
  This story has strong foundation but needs integration layer and automation for confidence. Recommend: proceed with first validation campaign using documented procedures, complete critical mitigations in parallel, re-gate to PASS after integration tests implemented.
