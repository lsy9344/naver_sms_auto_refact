status_reason: |
  2025-10-26 review: targeted runs of the validation and readiness suites still stop at
  21.44% and 9.61% coverage (vs ≥80%) because the automation never drives production
  modules. Channel parity checks and comparison-mode enforcement remain hard-coded, and
  evidence collection continues to fabricate CloudWatch/Slack artefacts, so no acceptance
  criteria have executable proof. Story 5.5 remains blocked from MSC1 sign-off.

    title: 'Validation workflow still not implemented in production'
    description: |
      `pytest tests/integration/test_validation_campaign.py --cov=src --cov-fail-under=80`
      still halts at 21.44% coverage. `ValidationEnvironmentConfig.validate` and
      `ValidationEnvironmentSetup.validate_prerequisites` never execute, so the suite
      bypasses the real campaign bootstrap and avoids `src/main.py`.

      - coverage.json:1
      - pytest.ini:12
      - src/validation/environment.py:77
      - src/validation/environment.py:177
    remediation: |
      Promote the validation runner into `src/validation`, drive it via integration tests, and keep
      coverage ≥80% by executing the real bootstrap + diff workflow instead of the synthetic harness.

  - id: 'OPS-001'
    severity: critical
    title: 'Readiness gate automation remains test-only with 0% coverage'
    description: |
      `pytest tests/integration/test_readiness_gate.py --cov=src --cov-fail-under=80` exits at
      9.61% coverage and never invokes the production readiness helpers. Channel checks in
      `_validate_sms_channel` / `_validate_dynamodb_channel` / `_validate_telegram_channel`
      return hard-coded zeros, and `_validate_comparison_mode_enabled` always reports `True`, so the
      go/no-go decision ignores real campaign data.

      - pytest.ini:12
      - src/validation/readiness.py:143
      - src/validation/readiness.py:221
    remediation: |
      Implement a production readiness validator module, feed it campaign outputs, and update the
      tests to import it so coverage is collected from real code paths and the gate can pass.

  - id: 'BUS-001'
    severity: critical
    title: 'Evidence packaging and documentation are inaccurate'
    description: |
      Evidence collection still fabricates CloudWatch metrics, alarm logs, and Slack transcripts when
      backing files are missing (`src/validation/evidence.py:97`, `:118`, `:142`), so packaging can pass
      without any real validation artefacts. VALIDATION.md therefore cannot be trusted as a dossier.
    suggested_owner: 'dev'
    refs:
      - src/validation/evidence.py:97
      - src/validation/evidence.py:118
      - src/validation/evidence.py:142
    remediation: |
      Build a production evidence packager that writes to VALIDATION.md with real campaign artefacts,
      rerun the campaign, and rewrite the dossier before requesting another gate.

  - id: 'SEC-001'
    severity: high
    title: 'Comparison mode governance unverified in readiness automation'
    description: |
      `_validate_comparison_mode_enabled` is hard-coded to `True`, and no integration tests exercise the
      Lambda handler with comparison mode disabled, so accidental production SMS sends remain possible.
    suggested_owner: 'dev'
    refs:
      - src/validation/readiness.py:221
      - src/main.py:8
    remediation: |
      Ensure the readiness validator exercises `COMPARISON_MODE_ENABLED`, capture the result inside the
      readiness report, and include integration coverage that fails if the flag is disabled during a campaign.

  - id: 'PERF-001'
    severity: high
    title: 'Performance suite impractical with 1.2s sleeps per booking'
    description: |
      `CampaignPerformanceSimulator` is still never executed—coverage remains 0% for the simulator and
      no timing metrics are collected, leaving Lambda performance thresholds unverified.
    suggested_owner: 'dev'
    refs:
      - coverage.json:1
      - src/validation/performance.py:70
      - src/validation/performance.py:97
    remediation: |
      Replace sleeps with deterministic timing, wire the simulator into the production validation flow,
      and gather real execution metrics so the performance suite satisfies coverage and PRD thresholds.

code_quality_assessment: |
  Component code remains isolated and solid, but every piece of Story 5.5 automation still lives in `tests/`.
  The integration suites fabricate their own environments, never touch production modules, and therefore
  fail the repo coverage gate (14% / 0%). Documentation claims 100% parity despite coverage failures and
  missing artefacts.

files_modified_during_review: []

next_steps: |
  1. Move validation, readiness, and evidence automation into production modules and satisfy coverage gates.
  2. Execute a real validation campaign, capture artefacts, and rewrite VALIDATION.md before requesting QA again.
  3. Enforce comparison-mode kill switch behaviour and stabilise the performance harness so CI can exercise it.

gate_decision_rationale: |
  The story remains in FAIL. All validation suites fail the repository coverage gate because automation remains
  trapped under `tests/`, the comparison kill switch is still case-insensitive, and VALIDATION.md advertises success
  despite missing artefacts. Until production-grade automation and evidence exist, the cutover cannot move forward.
