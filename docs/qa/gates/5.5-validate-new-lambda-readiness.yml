gate: FAIL
status_reason: |
  2025-10-23 re-review: validation, readiness, and evidence suites now complete their
  assertions but each run still fails the repository coverage gate (14% / 0%), because
  all automation continues to execute exclusively under `tests/`. Documentation still
  advertises a GO decision without executable artefacts, so the cutover remains blocked.

    title: 'Validation workflow still not implemented in production'
    description: |
      `pytest tests/integration/test_validation_campaign.py` now passes assertions but exits with
      `Coverage failure: total of 14 is less than fail-under=80` because it still imports
      `ValidationEnvironmentSetup` from `tests/validation_environment.py`. No production module
      orchestrates the campaign, so the repo gate blocks validation.
    suggested_owner: 'dev'
    refs:
      - tests/integration/test_validation_campaign.py:26
      - tests/validation_environment.py:19
    remediation: |
      Promote the validation runner into `src/validation`, exercise production modules, and satisfy the
      ≥80% repository coverage gate so the suite can pass.

  - id: 'OPS-001'
    severity: critical
    title: 'Readiness gate automation remains test-only with 0% coverage'
    description: |
      The readiness validator lives entirely inside `tests/integration/test_readiness_gate.py`, and
      running the suite produces 0% coverage and an immediate fail-under=80% abort. No code under `src/`
      generates a readiness report or updates VALIDATION.md.
    suggested_owner: 'dev'
    refs:
      - tests/integration/test_readiness_gate.py:18
    remediation: |
      Implement a production readiness validator module, feed it campaign outputs, and update the
      tests to import it so coverage is collected from real code paths.

  - id: 'BUS-001'
    severity: critical
    title: 'Evidence packaging and documentation are inaccurate'
    description: |
      `pytest tests/integration/test_evidence_packaging.py` exits with 0% coverage, yet `VALIDATION.md`
      still advertises “24/24 PASSED” and a GO recommendation. No artefacts are appended to VALIDATION.md,
      and the doc misrepresents the state of the story.
    suggested_owner: 'dev'
    refs:
      - tests/integration/test_evidence_packaging.py:688
      - VALIDATION.md:2298
    remediation: |
      Build a production evidence packager that writes to VALIDATION.md, rerun the campaign, and rewrite
      the dossier with real outputs before requesting another gate.

  - id: 'SEC-001'
    severity: high
    title: 'Comparison mode kill switch still case-insensitive'
    description: |
      `COMPARISON_MODE_ENABLED` continues to lowercase the environment flag (`.lower() == "true"`), contrary
      to the documented fix. No integration coverage prevents live SMS when the env var is set to "TRUE".
    suggested_owner: 'dev'
    refs:
      - src/config/settings.py:52
      - VALIDATION.md:2298
    remediation: |
      Enforce a case-sensitive flag comparison in `src/config/settings.py`, add handler-level tests that
      exercise comparison mode, and document the behaviour accurately.

  - id: 'PERF-001'
    severity: high
    title: 'Performance suite impractical with 1.2s sleeps per booking'
    description: |
      `CampaignPerformanceSimulator` sleeps for 1.2 seconds per booking when `simulate_delay=True`, so the
      integration suite times out long before finishing (200 bookings ≈ 240 seconds of sleep).
    suggested_owner: 'dev'
    refs:
      - tests/integration/test_campaign_performance.py:129
    remediation: |
      Replace the real sleeps with deterministic timing fakes/mocks so the performance harness runs in
      seconds and can meaningfully validate PRD thresholds.

code_quality_assessment: |
  Component code remains isolated and solid, but every piece of Story 5.5 automation still lives in `tests/`.
  The integration suites fabricate their own environments, never touch production modules, and therefore
  fail the repo coverage gate (14% / 0%). Documentation claims 100% parity despite coverage failures and
  missing artefacts.

files_modified_during_review: []

next_steps: |
  1. Move validation, readiness, and evidence automation into production modules and satisfy coverage gates.
  2. Execute a real validation campaign, capture artefacts, and rewrite VALIDATION.md before requesting QA again.
  3. Enforce comparison-mode kill switch behaviour and stabilise the performance harness so CI can exercise it.

gate_decision_rationale: |
  The story remains in FAIL. All validation suites fail the repository coverage gate because automation remains
  trapped under `tests/`, the comparison kill switch is still case-insensitive, and VALIDATION.md advertises success
  despite missing artefacts. Until production-grade automation and evidence exist, the cutover cannot move forward.
