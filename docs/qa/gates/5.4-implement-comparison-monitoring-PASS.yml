gate: PASS
status_reason: |
  Gate promoted to PASS. Terraform root module and environment tfvars forward Story 5.4 comparison
  variables (namespace, thresholds, Slack/Telegram webhooks) into the CloudWatch module so
  comparison metric filters, alarms, and dashboard widgets deploy consistently. Lambda execution
  role attachments grant `cloudwatch:PutMetricData` and `sns:Publish`, satisfying AC 2/5/7. Validation
  artefacts (`docs/validation/story-5.4/terraform-plan-dev.txt`,
  `docs/validation/story-5.4/alarm-notification-slack.json`) record terraform plan output and induced
  Slack/Telegram alarm payloads, closing AC 5/9 evidence requirements.

dev_notes: |
  **Validation Summary**
  - Terraform root module + env tfvars pass comparison configuration into `modules/cloudwatch`, enabling comparison metric
    filters, alarms, and widgets in all environments.
  - `aws_iam_policy.lambda_metrics_and_notifications` attaches to the Lambda execution role, granting `cloudwatch:PutMetricData`
    and `sns:Publish` for telemetry emission.
  - Validation artefacts captured under `docs/validation/story-5.4/` include terraform plan output and Slack/Telegram alarm
    payload JSON, referenced within `VALIDATION.md`.
  - Operational documentation (`docs/ops/runbook.md`, `docs/ops/cloudwatch-queries.md`) remains aligned with deployed resources.
