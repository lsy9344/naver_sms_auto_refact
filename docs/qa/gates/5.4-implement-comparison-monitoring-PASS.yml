gate: PASS
status_reason: |
  All 10 acceptance criteria are implemented and validated. Terraform provisions comparison
  dashboards and alarms with Slack/Telegram/email routing
  (`infrastructure/terraform/modules/cloudwatch/main.tf`), operational guides are updated for
  Story 5.4 (`docs/ops/runbook.md`, `docs/ops/cloudwatch-queries.md`), and validation artifacts
  are captured in `VALIDATION.md`. Comparison monitoring is ready for Story 5.5 validation and
  production deployment gating.

dev_notes: |
  **Implementation Summary**
  - Structured logs and metrics emitted from `src/monitoring/comparison.py` cover SMS, DynamoDB, and Telegram comparisons.
  - Terraform module now provisions comparison dashboards and seven alarms with Slack/Telegram/email targets (`infrastructure/terraform/modules/cloudwatch/main.tf`).
  - Operational documentation expanded with Story 5.4 procedures and queries (`docs/ops/runbook.md`, `docs/ops/cloudwatch-queries.md`).
  - Validation evidence (alarm simulations, dashboard captures, retention proof) stored in `VALIDATION.md`.

  **Resolved QA Findings (from CONCERNS review)**
  1. CloudWatch dashboard (AC 4) implemented with comparison widgets in Terraform.
  2. Alarm routing (AC 5) now fans out to Slack, Telegram, and email; match percentage and discrepancy alarms added.
  3. Logs Insights catalog (AC 6) documents comparison queries with usage guidance.
  4. Runbook (AC 8) updated with response workflows for comparison alarms.
  5. Validation evidence (AC 9) documented with screenshots and alarm state transitions in `VALIDATION.md`.
