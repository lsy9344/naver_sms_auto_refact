gate: "PASS"
status_reason: "Structured logging fully implemented with JSON formatting, PII redaction (phone numbers, secrets), correlation field injection. CloudWatch infrastructure provisioned via Terraform: log group (90-day retention, encryption), 4 metric filters (SMS/login/secrets), 5-widget dashboard, 3 alarms with SNS. Operational documentation comprehensive: runbook with 6 alarm response procedures, 25+ Logs Insights queries. All 23 unit tests passing (100%), 67/70 full suite (3 live tests properly skipped). Security scans clean: bandit (0 issues), detect-secrets (0 leaks). AC1-12 fully evidenced with zero defects."

  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "PII redaction (phone 010-****-5678) + secret masking prevent log leakage. JSON format enables CloudWatch log queries without exposing sensitive data. bandit + detect-secrets confirm no credentials in code."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Logger initialization <10ms (verified in tests). JSON formatting minimal overhead. StreamHandler async writes don't block Lambda execution. No cold start regression."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Metric filters with JSON pattern matching reliable. Alarms use conservative thresholds (errors ≥1). SNS notifications ensure alerting even if dashboard missed. 23/23 tests cover happy/error paths."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Structured logging centralizes correlation field injection. PiiRedactor class reusable. Terraform modularizes CloudWatch config. Runbook + Logs Insights queries enable rapid troubleshooting."
recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - "After 1 week production operation, review alarm thresholds and adjust based on actual error patterns"
    - "Consider Lambda Layer for logger utility if deployed to multiple functions"
    - "Plan integration with Lambda monitoring service (e.g., Datadog, New Relic) for richer tracing"
