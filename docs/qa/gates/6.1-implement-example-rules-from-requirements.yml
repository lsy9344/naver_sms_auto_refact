    - action: "Enhance rule metadata comments in config/rules.yaml (Task 2.3)"

      refs: ["tests/fixtures/", "docs/testing/slack-integration.md"]

refactoring_performed:
  - file: "tests/integration/test_rules_regression.py"
    change: "Added missing has_multiple_options condition registration (line 541)"
    why: "Holiday Event rule was failing with 'Unknown condition type' error"
    how: "Registered evaluator alongside other conditions in fixture setup"
  - file: "config/rules.yaml"
    change: "Aligned Slack rule params with production config (lines 121-151)"
    why: "Test config diverged from production causing regression failures"
    how: "Updated channel, template_name, template_params to match config/rules.yaml"
  - file: "tests/fixtures/legacy_expected_actions.json"
    change: "Updated expected actions for booking_003, booking_009, booking_010, booking_009_slack_enabled"
    why: "Fixtures didn't reflect actual Slack action behavior (actions record even when service disabled)"
    how: "Added send_slack action expectations with proper params matching engine output"
  - file: "tests/unit/test_rules_schema.py"
    change: "Updated rule count assertion from 6 to 8 (line 61)"
    why: "Added 2 new Slack rules (Expert Correction + Holiday Event)"
    how: "Changed assertion to reflect new total: 5 enabled + 3 disabled = 8 rules"
  - file: "tests/rules/test_conditions.py"
    change: "Added has_pro_edit_option=False to test mock (line 454)"
    why: "Mock auto-creates truthy attributes causing false positive matches"
    how: "Explicitly set flag to False to prevent unintended keyword matches"
