    severity: high
    finding: "IAM client uses region ap-northeast-2, but IAM is a global service, so boto3 cannot reach the endpoint and tests abort."
    suggested_action: "Update tests/infrastructure/test_ecr.py to let the IAM client use the global endpoint (drop the region override) and re-run the suite."
