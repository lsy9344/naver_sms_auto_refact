    Story 3.3 demonstrates excellent implementation quality across all dimensions:

    FUNCTIONAL: All 6 action executors implemented with consistent patterns. Legacy behaviors
    preserved (SMS routing, flag updates, schema). Registration pattern correctly wires
    executors into RuleEngine.

    TECHNICAL: Immutable ActionContext design ensures thread-safety and testability. Comprehensive
    error wrapping prevents state corruption. Idempotency prevents duplicate actions.

    QUALITY: 39 tests passing (100% success rate). Zero linting violations. Mypy strict mode passes.
    Comprehensive docstrings and examples.

    RISK: LOW. All legacy behaviors preserved. Immutable design prevents subtle bugs. Idempotency
    prevents duplicates. Error isolation prevents cascading failures.

    RECOMMENDATION: Ready for immediate promotion to Done status.
