    finding: "Descriptions defined in infrastructure/secrets-manager.tf are generic and omit the exact JSON keys plus rotation cadence required by AC4."
    suggested_action: "Expand each secret description to list the contained fields (e.g., username/password) and note the manual rotation cadence (manual until Epic 5), then re-run validation."
