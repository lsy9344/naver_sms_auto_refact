story_title: "Migrate Credentials to Secrets Manager"
gate: "PASS"
status_reason: "Configuration loader fully implemented with Secrets Manager integration, exponential backoff retry logic, secret redaction for CloudWatch, 24/24 unit tests passing, security scans clean (bandit, detect-secrets). All AC1-8 evidenced; AC9 (git history) risk accepted per team decisionâ€”legacy code isolated in original_code/, refactored code has no hardcoded credentials."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "SecretRedactionFilter prevents accidental leakage to CloudWatch. Exponential backoff + error handling secure. Bandit 0 issues, detect-secrets 0 leaks."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Secrets fetched once on Lambda cold start and cached. No repeated AWS calls within container lifetime. LOCAL_SECRETS_FILE env var enables fast testing."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) handles transient failures. Descriptive error messages aid debugging. All 24 unit + 8 integration tests passing."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Configuration loader centralizes all credential access. Module-level convenience functions simplify caller code. Bootstrap script documents IAM requirements. Local setup guide comprehensive."
recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - "Consider adding @lru_cache decorator to credential loader functions to avoid repeated boto3 calls within cold start window (minor optimization)"
    - "Future work: Implement secret rotation via Secrets Manager rotation lambda (Story 5 dependency)"
