## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 🔴 TECH-001: Missing End-to-End Campaign Integration Tests

**Score: 9 (Critical)** | **Probability: HIGH (3)** | **Impact: HIGH (3)**

**Description**:
No integration test validates the complete validation campaign workflow from bootstrap through final reporting. Individual components (comparison, monitoring, Slack, CloudWatch) are unit-tested, but their integration is untested.

**Why This Matters**:
- Campaign could fail at integration points not caught by unit tests
- Issues could surface only during actual production validation campaign
- No way to verify campaign completes successfully before go/no-go meeting
- Rollback/recovery procedures untested

**Affected Components**:
- `scripts/bootstrap_validation_campaign.py` (no tests exist)
- `tests/validation_environment.py` (config only, no integration test)
- `tests/comparison/diff_reporter.py` (report generation, but not end-to-end)
- CloudWatch metric publishing → dashboard integration

**Mitigation Strategy** (Preventive):
1. Create `tests/integration/test_validation_campaign.py` with:
   - Full campaign bootstrap execution
   - Comparison suite execution
   - CloudWatch metric publishing verification
   - Slack notification delivery verification
   - Report artifact validation
   - Aggregate summary generation
2. Test success criteria validation (100% match, all channels working)
3. Test partial failure recovery (one booking fails, campaign continues)

**Testing Requirements**:
- [x] Design integration test structure
- [ ] Implement campaign execution mock (can't run real campaign in tests)
- [ ] Verify artifact generation
- [ ] Validate success criteria checks
- [ ] Add to CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Document how to run locally

**Residual Risk**: Medium - Even with integration test, cannot fully validate against production Slack/CloudWatch until actual campaign runs

**Owner**: dev  
**Timeline**: Must complete before story sign-off

### 🔴 OPS-001: Automated Readiness Decision Gate Missing (AC9)

**Score: 9 (Critical)** | **Probability: HIGH (3)** | **Impact: HIGH (3)**

**Description**:
Acceptance Criteria 9 requires "final readiness report aligns validation outcomes with PRD's functional parity success criteria" and "confirms MSC1 is satisfied prior to cutover approval," but there is **no automated validation** of success criteria. The go/no-go decision is completely manual.

**Why This Matters**:
- **Single point of failure**: Manual review of complex validation data prone to error
- **Consistency risk**: Different reviewers might apply different criteria
- **Audit trail gap**: No recorded decision logic or sign-off automation
- **Time risk**: Manual compilation of evidence could delay go/no-go decision
- **Repeatability**: If rollback needed, revalidation process unclear

**Affected Components**:
- No automated readiness report generator
- No success criteria validator
- No MSC1 parity checker
- No sign-off checklist automation
- No decision audit trail

**Mitigation Strategy** (Preventive):
1. Create automated readiness validator:
   ```python
   # tests/integration/test_readiness_gate.py
   def validate_readiness_criteria():
       # Check 100% parity across SMS, DynamoDB, Telegram, Slack
       # Verify all 4 channels tested
       # Confirm zero critical mismatches
       # Validate no real SMS sent during validation
       # Generate MSC1 compliance report
       # Return go/no-go recommendation
   ```
2. Generate final readiness report with:
   - Pass/fail for each success criterion
   - Evidence links for each claim
   - Channel-specific metrics (SMS, Telegram, Slack, DynamoDB)
   - Sign-off checklist
3. Create sign-off template for stakeholders

**Testing Requirements**:
- [ ] Implement success criteria validator
- [ ] Test validation logic against test fixtures
- [ ] Verify report generation
- [ ] Create stakeholder sign-off template
- [ ] Document go/no-go decision criteria

**Residual Risk**: Medium - Automated validator reduces human error, but final approval decision still requires human judgment

**Owner**: dev + PO  
**Timeline**: Must complete before first readiness review meeting

### 🔴 BUS-001: Incomplete Evidence Package Could Block Cutover

**Score: 9 (Critical)** | **Probability: MEDIUM-HIGH (2.5 → 3)** | **Impact: HIGH (3)**

**Description**:
AC6 requires validation evidence (test reports, metrics, alarms, approvals) "appended to VALIDATION.md and linked for readiness review," but there is **no automated evidence compilation**. The process is manual, with multiple opportunities for incomplete or missing artifacts.

**Why This Matters**:
- **Approval dependency**: Cutover cannot proceed without complete evidence package
- **Delay risk**: Incomplete package discovered during review delays cutover
- **Manual process fragile**: Easy to forget sections or lose links
- **Audit requirement**: Incomplete evidence fails audit requirements
- **Repeatability**: If evidence lost, campaign must re-run

**Affected Components**:
- `VALIDATION.md` (manually updated)
- CloudWatch dashboard exports (manual)
- Test reports (generated but not auto-linked)
- Alarm transcripts (manual copy)
- Slack notification evidence (unclear how documented)
- Approval artifacts (not defined)

**Mitigation Strategy** (Preventive):
1. Create evidence packager:
   ```python
   # tests/integration/test_evidence_packaging.py
   def package_validation_evidence():
       # Collect all test reports
       # Export CloudWatch metrics/dashboards
       # Extract alarm transition logs
       # Gather Slack notification history
       # Generate evidence manifest
       # Auto-append to VALIDATION.md
       # Return completeness checklist
   ```
2. Automate VALIDATION.md updates:
   - Generate markdown with all sections
   - Include links to artifacts
   - Cross-reference with PRD requirements
3. Create completeness validator:
   - Verify all required sections present
   - Check for orphaned links
   - Validate artifact timestamps

**Testing Requirements**:
- [ ] Implement evidence collection logic
- [ ] Test artifact linking
- [ ] Verify VALIDATION.md updates
- [ ] Create completeness checker
- [ ] Test with incomplete scenarios (missing sections)

**Residual Risk**: Low - Automation removes manual steps

**Owner**: dev  
**Timeline**: High priority (needed for evidence package)

## High-Risk Issues

### 🟠 SEC-001: Comparison Mode Kill Switch Not Verified

**Score: 6 (High)** | **Probability: MEDIUM (2)** | **Impact: HIGH (3)**

**Description**:
The VALIDATION.md mentions `COMPARISON_MODE_ENABLED` flag that should prevent production SMS, but:
- No explicit test validates the flag actually prevents SMS
- Lambda handler integration point unclear (where does the check happen?)
- No test simulating comparison mode disabled → production mode transition
- Residual risk of SMS leaking during validation if flag improperly set

**Affected Components**:
- `src/main.py` (Lambda handler - no visible COMPARISON_MODE check)
- `src/notifications/sms_service.py` (where the kill switch should prevent send)
- `src/config/settings.py` (flag definition)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Add explicit test:
   ```python
   def test_comparison_mode_prevents_production_sms():
       # Set COMPARISON_MODE_ENABLED=True
       # Attempt to send SMS
       # Verify SMS service raises exception OR logs as simulation
       # Test with multiple SMS scenarios
   ```
2. Verify handler integration:
   - Document where comparison mode is checked
   - Add handler test with mode enabled/disabled
3. Add mode transition test:
   - Start in comparison mode
   - Validate behavior
   - Disable mode
   - Verify production behavior active

**Testing Requirements**:
- [ ] Unit test for mode enforcement
- [ ] Handler integration test
- [ ] Mode transition test
- [ ] Manual verification procedure documented

**Residual Risk**: Medium - After testing, monitor in staging before production cutover

**Owner**: dev  
**Timeline**: Before first validation campaign

### 🟠 PERF-001: Campaign Performance Under Load Untested

**Score: 6 (High)** | **Probability: MEDIUM (2)** | **Impact: HIGH (3)**

**Description**:
Validation environment specifies performance thresholds (4min Lambda exec, 10s cold start, 512MB memory, 100ms DynamoDB latency), but:
- No test validates campaign completes within time budgets
- No test measures actual CloudWatch metric publishing throughput
- No test validates memory usage under 100+ booking comparisons
- Campaign could timeout if bookings exceed expected volume

**Affected Components**:
- `tests/validation_environment.py` (thresholds defined but not validated)
- `src/monitoring/comparison.py` (publishes metrics, batch size unknown)
- Lambda execution time (varies with booking count)
- CloudWatch metric publishing (rate limiting at AWS)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Create performance baseline:
   ```python
   def test_campaign_performance_scaling():
       # Run comparison with 10, 50, 100, 200 bookings
       # Measure execution time, memory, CloudWatch calls
       # Verify 4-min threshold not exceeded at expected scale
       # Test CloudWatch batch publishing (20-metric limit)
   ```
2. Test metric publishing throughput:
   - Simulate high-frequency metric updates
   - Verify batching prevents rate limiting
   - Test backoff on 429 responses
3. Memory profiling:
   - Monitor memory during large comparison
   - Verify no memory leaks

**Testing Requirements**:
- [ ] Implement performance scaling test
- [ ] Add memory profiling
- [ ] CloudWatch rate limit simulation
- [ ] Document expected performance curves
- [ ] Set up monitoring in CloudWatch

**Residual Risk**: Medium - Production campaign could still exceed thresholds if booking distribution different than test

**Owner**: dev  
**Timeline**: Before UAT validation campaign

### 🟠 DATA-001: Validation Data Versioning Not Enforced

**Score: 6 (High)** | **Probability: MEDIUM (2)** | **Impact: HIGH (3)**

**Description**:
ValidationEnvironmentConfig includes `test_data_version` field, but:
- No validation that golden dataset version matches code version
- Could accidentally run old fixtures against new Lambda code
- Could run new fixtures against old code
- Versioning mismatch could invalidate comparison results
- No automated version compatibility check

**Affected Components**:
- `tests/validation_environment.py` (version field exists, not validated)
- `tests/fixtures/` (dataset versions unknown/undocumented)
- Test selection logic (no version check before running)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Add version validation:
   ```python
   def validate_data_version_compatibility():
       # Load code version (from git tag or __version__)
       # Load fixture version (from fixture metadata)
       # Verify match or compatible range
       # Raise exception if incompatible
   ```
2. Document versioning scheme:
   - Code version scheme (semver)
   - Fixture version scheme
   - Compatibility matrix
3. Automate version check in bootstrap:
   - Enforce version match before campaign starts
   - Log version compatibility check results

**Testing Requirements**:
- [ ] Implement version compatibility checker
- [ ] Test with compatible/incompatible versions
- [ ] Add version metadata to fixtures
- [ ] Document versioning procedures

**Residual Risk**: Low - After validation implemented

**Owner**: dev  
**Timeline**: Before first production validation

---

### 🟠 OPS-002: Bootstrap Script Has No Automated Tests

**Score: 6 (High)** | **Probability: MEDIUM (2)** | **Impact: HIGH (3)**

**Description**:
`scripts/bootstrap_validation_campaign.py` orchestrates campaign setup but has **no automated tests**. Script errors only discovered at runtime:
- Prerequisite validation logic untested
- Directory creation logic untested
- Metadata generation untested
- Slack webhook test verification untested
- Configuration defaults untested

**Affected Components**:
- `scripts/bootstrap_validation_campaign.py` (no tests)
- `tests/validation_environment.py` (config class tested, but not bootstrap integration)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Create bootstrap test suite:
   ```python
   # tests/scripts/test_bootstrap_validation_campaign.py
   def test_validate_environment_prerequisites():
       # Test with valid/invalid configs
       # Test with missing/present directories
       # Test Slack webhook reachability
   
   def test_bootstrap_environment():
       # Verify directories created
       # Verify metadata files generated
       # Verify permissions correct
   
   def test_slack_webhook_connectivity():
       # Mock HTTP responses
       # Test success/failure scenarios
       # Test retry logic
   ```
2. Add unit tests for each bootstrap phase
3. Add integration test that runs full bootstrap
4. Document script prerequisites and troubleshooting

**Testing Requirements**:
- [ ] Unit test prerequisite validation
- [ ] Unit test environment setup
- [ ] Integration test full bootstrap
- [ ] Add to CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Document manual execution procedures

**Residual Risk**: Medium - Even with tests, must test in staging before production

**Owner**: dev  
**Timeline**: Before first validation campaign

## Medium-Risk Issues

### 🟡 TECH-002: Slack Webhook Integration Untested in Comparison Flow

**Score: 4 (Medium)** | **Probability: MEDIUM (2)** | **Impact: MEDIUM (2)**

**Description**:
- SlackWebhookClient is unit-tested
- Comparison diff reporter mentions Slack payloads
- But: No integration test validates Slack payloads actually sent during comparison
- No test validating Slack webhook payload format matches expectations
- Slack delivery failures during campaign might go unnoticed

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Add Slack payload comparison test:
   ```python
   def test_slack_webhook_payloads_during_comparison():
       # Mock Slack webhook
       # Run comparison with mismatches
       # Verify Slack received correct payloads
       # Validate payload structure (blocks, fields, timestamps)
   ```
2. Test failure scenarios:
   - Slack rate limiting (429)
   - Slack timeout
   - Slack delivery failure → campaign continues

**Residual Risk**: Low after testing

---

### 🟡 TECH-003: CloudWatch Integration Not E2E Tested

**Score: 4 (Medium)** | **Probability: MEDIUM (2)** | **Impact: MEDIUM (2)**

**Description**:
- CloudWatch infrastructure deployed via Terraform
- ComparisonMetricsPublisher unit-tested with mocks
- But: No integration test validates metrics actually reach CloudWatch
- No test verifying metric filters work correctly
- No test validating alarms trigger on thresholds
- Dashboard widgets might display empty data

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Create CloudWatch integration test:
   ```python
   def test_comparison_metrics_published_to_cloudwatch():
       # Enable CloudWatch mocking or use staging environment
       # Publish test metrics
       # Query CloudWatch to verify metrics received
       # Verify metric dimensions correct
   ```
2. Verify alarm integration:
   - Publish threshold-exceeding metric
   - Verify alarm transitions to ALARM state
   - Verify SNS notification sent
3. Dashboard widget verification:
   - Verify widgets render with data
   - Check query syntax

**Residual Risk**: Low after testing

---

### 🟡 TECH-004: Campaign Failure Recovery Untested

**Score: 4 (Medium)** | **Probability: LOW-MEDIUM (1.5 → 2)** | **Impact: MEDIUM (2)**

**Description**:
Campaign execution paths for partial failures undefined:
- What if one booking comparison fails? (Campaign continues? Stops?)
- What if Slack webhook unreachable? (Campaign continues silently?)
- What if CloudWatch metric publishing rate-limited? (Retry? Skip?)
- What if DynamoDB comparison can't read records? (Booking skipped? Fails campaign?)
- No documented recovery procedures

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Define failure recovery policy:
   - Transient failures → retry with backoff
   - Slack unavailable → log but continue (Slack is non-critical)
   - CloudWatch rate limit → batch retry
   - DynamoDB unavailable → fail booking but continue campaign
2. Document in runbook
3. Test each failure scenario

**Residual Risk**: Medium - Requires careful implementation and testing

---

### 🟡 PERF-002: Slack Notification Delivery Timing Not Validated

**Score: 4 (Medium)** | **Probability: MEDIUM (2)** | **Impact: MEDIUM (2)**

**Description**:
- AC5 requires "comparison-related alarms triggered during testing [are] triaged within SLA"
- SLA is <15 minutes for rollback
- But: No test validates alarm → Slack notification time is within SLA
- Slack delivery delays could violate SLA without detection

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Add SLA validation test:
   ```python
   def test_alarm_notification_sla():
       # Trigger alarm
       # Measure time to Slack notification received
       # Verify < 15 minutes
   ```
2. Test with real Slack API (staging environment)
3. Add CloudWatch alarm for notification latency

**Residual Risk**: Low after testing
