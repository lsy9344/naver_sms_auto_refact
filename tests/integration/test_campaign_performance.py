Campaign Performance Scaling Tests

Story 5.5 PERF-001: Validates campaign performance at different scales.

Tests that validation campaign completes within performance budgets:
- Execution duration: < 4 minutes
- Cold start: < 10 seconds
- Memory: < 512MB
- DynamoDB latency: < 100ms per operation

Validates performance across booking volumes: 10, 50, 100, 200
