# VALIDATION REPORT: Story 6.6 - Create Rule Management Documentation

**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Story:** 6.6  
**Status:** DRAFT (Pre-Implementation)  
**Validator:** Sarah (Product Owner)  
**Validation Level:** COMPREHENSIVE

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**VALIDATION RESULT: ⚠️ NO-GO - Critical Issues Found**

Story 6.6 contains **critical blockers** that must be resolved before implementation can proceed. While the scope and intent are clear, the story has **significant dependency uncertainties** and **incomplete technical specifications** that prevent a development agent from proceeding confidently.

**Implementation Readiness Score: 5/10**  
**Confidence Level: LOW**

---

## CRITICAL ISSUES (Story Blocked)

### ❌ ISSUE 1: Unresolved Dependency Timing (AC1, AC3, AC5)

**Severity:** CRITICAL - Story cannot start

**Problem:**
Story 6.6 explicitly depends on Stories 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, and 6.1 being completed first:
- Story 6.6 Dev Notes: "Wait for Stories 6.2–6.4 and 6.1 to land so guide content reflects shipped functionality."
- Story 6.6 appears as "Step 5" in Epic 6 story sequence, after Story 6.1 ("Step 4")

**Issue:**
However, **Story 6.1 acceptance criteria (AC5) explicitly requires** the business-facing documentation in `docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide` to be complete:

From Story 6.1 AC5:
> "Business-facing documentation in `docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide` explains how to enable, tune, or disable the example rules..."

**Circular Dependency:**
- Story 6.1 **REQUIRES** the documentation that Story 6.6 **PRODUCES**
- Story 6.6 **REQUIRES** Stories 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 to be completed first

**This is a deadlock.** Story 6.1 cannot complete without the documentation that Story 6.6 creates, but Story 6.6 cannot start until Story 6.1 completes.

**Resolution Required:**
One of these must be done:
1. Move Rule Management Documentation into Story 6.1 as part of its AC5 requirement
2. Split Story 6.6 into two: (a) Business user guide (needed for 6.1), (b) Advanced documentation (after 6.1)
3. Explicitly mark as "Develop documentation in parallel with 6.1, deliver with 6.1"
4. Reorder: Make Story 6.6 occur BEFORE Story 6.1

**Status:** ❌ UNRESOLVED

---

### ❌ ISSUE 2: Incomplete Technical Specifications for Deliverables

**Severity:** CRITICAL - Implementation ambiguity

**Problem:** Story lacks concrete specifications for deliverables:

#### AC1: "Detailed, versioned guide"

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Exact location where guide should live: Epic 6 section? New standalone document?
- ❌ Required sections are vague: "coverage rule anatomy, condition/action catalog, configuration steps..."
  - "Configuration steps" - for whom? How detailed?
  - "Catalog" - should this mirror developer docs or be simplified?
- ❌ No specification of whether guide replaces or supplements existing `docs/rules/rules-config.md`

**Story Says:** "Expand `docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide`"

**Reality Check:** Epic 6 currently contains a **skeletal section** (~15 lines) with basic topics listed, not a detailed guide.

**What Developer Needs:** Clear specification of:
- Target word count / scope (is this a 2-page guide or 20-page manual?)
- Audience reading level (non-technical ops? DevOps engineers?)
- Content structure (what exact sections?)
- Format (inline in Epic 6? New file `docs/rules/business-user-guide.md`?)

**Status:** ❌ UNSPECIFIED

---

#### AC2: "Quick-reference checklist"

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Exact format: Markdown checklist? HTML template? Printable PDF?
- ❌ What "pre-change, change, post-change steps" means in practice
  - Example: For changing a rule from enabled=true to enabled=false, what are the steps?
  - Is backup just "git diff" or actual file duplication?
  - What testing is "required" vs "optional"?
- ❌ What "monitoring signals" and "rollback triggers" are: No concrete examples given
  - What metrics should ops watch? Lambda duration? Error rates? SMS delivery?
  - What constitutes "rule failed" and triggers rollback?

**Story Says:** "provide step-by-step instructions"

**Reality:** Step-by-step for what? Changing a rule parameter? Adding a new rule? Disabling a rule?

**What Developer Needs:**
- Concrete example checklist (maybe 3-5 variants for common changes)
- Definition of "monitoring signal" with real-world metrics
- Definition of "rollback trigger" with decision tree

**Status:** ❌ UNDERSPECIFIED

---

#### AC3: "Slack template documentation"

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Exact location of documentation: Add to existing `docs/testing/slack-integration.md`? Create new `docs/rules/slack-templates-guide.md`?
- ❌ "Mask PII" - which fields? How? Existing masking function referenced?
  - Story references: "mask PII per existing helpers"
  - But: ❌ No concrete specification of which helpers or how to use them
- ❌ "Validate changes using integration tests" - which tests exactly?
  - Story says: "cross-links to docs/testing/slack-integration.md are included"
  - But: Unclear what specific testing steps ops should follow

**Story Says:** "describes how to edit `config/slack_templates.yaml`"

**Reality:** Story doesn't exist yet (Story 6.2). What format will `config/slack_templates.yaml` have?

**What Developer Needs:**
- Concrete example: "To add a new Slack template..."
- Step-by-step: Edit the YAML → validate syntax → run tests → commit
- Concrete test commands ops should run

**Status:** ❌ INCOMPLETE

---

#### AC4: "Testing guidance"

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ "How to run regression tests" - which test files? Which commands?
  - Existing: `tests/integration/test_rules_regression.py`
  - But: Are there new test files that Story 6.1 creates?
  - Story depends on Story 6.1 but doesn't reference its test additions
- ❌ "Interpret results" - what does a passing test look like? Failing?
- ❌ "Revert configuration if tests fail" - rollback procedure for different failure types

**Story Says:** "pytest commands, data setup"

**Reality:** Story doesn't provide example pytest commands or data setup instructions

**What Developer Needs:**
- Concrete command examples: `pytest tests/integration/test_rules_regression.py -v`
- What "data setup" means: Fixtures? Sample bookings?
- What to do when tests fail: Exact rollback steps

**Status:** ❌ VAGUE

---

#### AC5: "Example YAML snippets"

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Story references rules from Story 6.1, but Story 6.1 **hasn't been implemented yet**
- ❌ No concrete specification of which rules to document
- ❌ "Show how to adjust keywords, date ranges, channels, and templates safely"
  - Safe adjustment means what? Validation steps? Testing requirements?

**Story Says:** "Example YAML snippets for 'Expert Correction Slack Digest' and 'Holiday Event Customer List'"

**Reality:** These rules are defined in Story 6.1, which hasn't been implemented yet. Story 6.6 author cannot preview exact YAML without implementing 6.1 first.

**What Developer Needs:**
- Wait for Story 6.1 implementation to see final YAML structure
- OR: Have clear template for how to document rule parameters generically

**Status:** ❌ FORWARD-DEPENDENT

---

#### AC6: "Monitoring and rollback expectations"

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ "Specific signals to watch" - not defined
  - Examples: Lambda duration spike? Error rate increase? SMS delivery delay?
- ❌ "Explicit rollback triggers" - not specified
  - Examples: >10% error rate? >1 minute lambda duration? Customer complaints?
- ❌ "Parties responsible for observing" - not defined
  - Who is "the operator"? DevOps? Business analyst? On-call engineer?

**Story Says:** "the operator checklist defines specific signals"

**Reality:** Checklist hasn't been drafted yet. Developer must invent concrete signals.

**What Developer Needs:**
- Concrete SLI/SLO definitions from operations team
- Alert thresholds for rollback decision
- Clear ownership (who watches? who decides rollback?)

**Status:** ❌ NOT SPECIFIED

---

#### AC7: "Rollout communication plan and feedback loop"

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ "Stakeholders" - who? Product? Operations? Customer support?
- ❌ "Channel" - Slack? Email? Wiki?
- ❌ "Timing" - when should communication happen? Before deploy? After?
- ❌ "Collecting and acting on feedback" - what feedback mechanism?
  - "Dedicated issue label"? Which labels? In which repo?
  - "Ops retro agenda"? How often? What cadence?

**Story Says:** "the process for collecting and acting on feedback"

**Reality:** No concrete process defined

**What Developer Needs:**
- Explicit stakeholder list with contact info or distribution
- Specific communication channels (e.g., "#operations" Slack channel)
- Feedback collection mechanism (e.g., GitHub issues with label "rule-feedback")
- Retro schedule (e.g., weekly operations retro)

**Status:** ❌ UNDERSPECIFIED

---

#### AC8: "Verification steps for command snippets"

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ "Documented dry run of pytest commands" - what does this mean?
  - Run on what environment? CI/CD? Local?
  - What counts as "success" for a dry run?
  - Where should results be documented?
- ❌ "Record results in the changelog" - changelog of what?
  - Documentation changelog? Separate verification log?

**Story Says:** "before publication"

**Reality:** "Publication" means what? Merging to main? Deploying docs to wiki?

**What Developer Needs:**
- Clear verification process:
  - Step 1: Run all test commands in dev environment
  - Step 2: Document output in file X
  - Step 3: Include in PR description
  - Step 4: Reviewer confirms results

**Status:** ❌ NOT CLEARLY DEFINED

---

#### AC9: "Changelog or future-work section"

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ "Known limitations" - not specified
  - Story mentions "automation of Slack template validation" as example
  - Are there other known limitations?
- ❌ "Post-MVP opportunities" - not defined
  - What opportunities exist?
  - Who should define them?

**Story Says:** "highlights post-MVP opportunities or known limitations"

**Reality:** Story doesn't identify specific limitations or opportunities

**What Developer Needs:**
- Concrete list of known limitations (from Story 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.1 implementation)
- Concrete post-MVP improvements to suggest

**Status:** ❌ NEEDS INPUT FROM PREVIOUS STORIES

## SHOULD-FIX ISSUES (Important Quality Improvements)

### ⚠️ ISSUE 3: Acceptance Criteria Are Overly Ambitious

**Severity:** IMPORTANT - Scope creep risk

**Problem:**
9 acceptance criteria for a documentation story is high. Let me map them:

1. AC1: Business guide (large scope)
2. AC2: Operator checklist (new artifact)
3. AC3: Slack template docs (new artifact)
4. AC4: Testing guidance (new content)
5. AC5: Example YAML (new content, depends on 6.1)
6. AC6: Monitoring/rollback (new content)
7. AC7: Communication plan (new content)
8. AC8: Verification steps (process improvement)
9. AC9: Known limitations (new content)

**Issue:**
- AC1 alone could be a full story (business user guide = substantial documentation)
- AC2-4 should each be individual acceptance criteria, not rolled into one story
- AC5-9 are all additional substantial content requirements on top of AC1-4

**Risk:**
Developer might:
- Produce shallow documentation to hit all 9 ACs
- Over-scope and miss deadline
- Produce incomplete sections

**Recommendation:**
Break into multiple stories:
- Story 6.6a: Business user guide (AC1, AC3, AC4) - 1-2 days
- Story 6.6b: Operator checklists and monitoring (AC2, AC6) - 1 day
- Story 6.6c: Communication and feedback process (AC7, AC8, AC9) - 0.5 days

**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS SCOPE CLARITY

---

### ⚠️ ISSUE 4: Task-to-AC Mapping Is Loose

**Severity:** IMPORTANT - Clarity

**Problem:**
Tasks map to multiple ACs, making it unclear what constitutes "done" for each task.

Example:
- Task 1: "Expand business-facing guide (AC: 1, 3, 5)"
  - AC1 alone (business guide) = full task
  - AC3 (Slack templates) = separate concern
  - AC5 (YAML examples) = depends on Story 6.1

**Issue:**
- Developer might complete Task 1 without fully addressing AC1
- Unclear if AC5 is Task 1 or requires Task 1 + wait for Story 6.1

**What Developer Needs:**
Clear task breakdown:
- Task 1: Draft business user guide sections (AC1)
- Task 2: Create operator checklist (AC2)
- Task 3: Add Slack template documentation (AC3)
- Task 4: Document testing procedures (AC4)
- Task 5: Add YAML examples (AC5, depends on 6.1)
- Task 6: Define monitoring/rollback (AC6)
- Task 7: Document communication plan (AC7)
- Task 8: Verification process (AC8)
- Task 9: Known limitations/future work (AC9)

**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS RESTRUCTURING

---

### ⚠️ ISSUE 5: No Concrete Examples or Templates

**Severity:** IMPORTANT - Implementation difficulty

**Problem:**
Story provides no examples of:
- What the "business user guide" should look like
- What the "operator checklist" should look like
- What the "communication plan" should look like

**Example Missing:**
- Story says: "provide step-by-step instructions operators must follow"
- But doesn't show: What does a checklist item look like?
  - `[ ] Step 1: Make a backup with 'git diff src/config/rules.yaml > /tmp/rules.backup'`
  - `[ ] Step 2: Edit rules.yaml and change enabled: true to enabled: false`
  - `[ ] Step 3: Run 'pytest tests/integration/test_rules_regression.py' and wait for pass/fail`

**What Developer Needs:**
- Example checklist for "disable a rule"
- Example checklist for "modify rule parameters"
- Example checklist for "add a new rule"
- Then generate 2-3 variations

**Status:** ⚠️ EXAMPLES WOULD HELP

## ANTI-HALLUCINATION VERIFICATION

### ✅ Claims Verified

| Claim | Source | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Rule engine in config/rules.yaml | src/config/rules.schema.json (exists) | ✅ Verified |
| Slack integration in Story 6.2 | docs/stories/6.2.add-slack-integration.md (exists) | ✅ Verified |
| Date range in Story 6.3 | docs/stories/6.3.add-date-range-condition-evaluator.md (exists) | ✅ Verified |
| Multi-option in Story 6.4 | docs/stories/6.4.add-multi-option-condition-evaluator.md (exists) | ✅ Verified |
| Example rules in Story 6.1 | docs/stories/6.1.implement-example-rules-from-requirements.md (exists) | ✅ Verified |
| docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md exists | File found | ✅ Verified |
| docs/testing/slack-integration.md exists | File found | ✅ Verified |
| docs/rules/rules-config.md exists | File found | ✅ Verified |

### ❌ Forward Dependencies Not Yet Available

- Story 6.1 hasn't been implemented (dependencies exist but not deliverables)
- Story 6.2 hasn't been implemented (slack_templates.yaml format unknown)
- Story 6.3 hasn't been implemented (no date_range test examples available)
- Story 6.4 hasn't been implemented (no multi-option test examples available)

**Impact:** Developer cannot validate documentation against actual implementations until those stories complete.

---

## FILE STRUCTURE VALIDATION

### ⚠️ Location Ambiguities

| Requirement | Specified Location | Actual Status | Issue |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| Guide | `docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide` | Exists but skeletal (~15 lines) | Will need significant expansion |
| Checklist | `docs/rules/rule-change-checklist.md` or equivalent | ❌ Doesn't exist | "Or equivalent" is too vague |
| Supporting docs | `docs/testing/slack-integration.md` | ✅ Exists | Good |
| Supporting docs | `docs/rules/rules-config.md` | ✅ Exists | Good |

### ⚠️ Decision Needed: Where Does Guide Live?

**Option A: Expand Epic 6 section**
- Pros: Keeps it in one place
- Cons: Epic 6 file could become huge

**Option B: New standalone file `docs/rules/business-user-guide.md`**
- Pros: Dedicated guide, easier to maintain
- Cons: New file to manage

**Story doesn't specify.** Developer must make this decision or Story requires clarification.

---

## DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS

### ✅ Upstream Dependencies Documented

Story correctly identifies:
- Depends on Stories 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.1
- Correct sequence shown in Epic 6

### ❌ Downstream Dependency on Story 6.1 AC5 (CRITICAL)

**The Circular Dependency:**

Story 6.1 AC5 states:
> "Business-facing documentation in `docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide` explains how to enable, tune, or disable the example rules..."

Story 6.6 produces this documentation.

**Timeline Conflict:**
- Story 6.1 **requires** documentation to complete
- Story 6.6 **requires** Story 6.1 to complete
- These are sequential stories with circular AC dependency

**This must be resolved before proceeding.**

---

## TESTING COVERAGE

### ⚠️ Testing Section Is Vague

**What Story Says:**
```
### Testing
- `pytest` commands in guide should be validated locally once (dry run) to confirm accuracy.
- Spell-check / Markdown linting via existing tooling (if available) before publishing.
```

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Who runs the dry run? Developer? QA? Operations?
- ❌ What environment? Local dev? Staging?
- ❌ What counts as "accuracy" validation?
  - Do all commands return expected output?
  - Do all commands exit with code 0?
  - Are all paths correct?
- ❌ Spell-check tool not specified (is there an existing tool?)
- ❌ Markdown linting tool not specified
- ❌ What happens if linting fails?

**What Developer Needs:**
- Concrete testing procedure
- Specific tools and commands
- Pass/fail criteria
- Who approves the documentation

**Status:** ⚠️ UNDERSPECIFIED

---

## DEFINITION OF DONE

### ✅ Concrete Checklist Items Present

- [ ] Guide content drafted, reviewed, and versioned
- [ ] Operator checklist published and linked
- [ ] Supporting docs updated (Slack integration + rules catalog)
- [ ] Commands/examples verified and documented
- [ ] Stakeholders sign off on documentation readiness...

**Note:** "Stakeholders sign off" is vague—who are the stakeholders? How do they sign off?

**Assessment:** Mostly good but needs stakeholder identification.

---

## VALIDATION SCORECARD

| Dimension | Score | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Template Compliance | 10/10 | ✅ |
| Acceptance Criteria Clarity | 3/10 | ❌ Highly ambiguous |
| Task Completeness | 4/10 | ⚠️ Loose mapping |
| Source Verification | 8/10 | ⚠️ Forward-dependent |
| Dependency Analysis | 2/10 | ❌ Critical circular dependency |
| Testing Specification | 3/10 | ⚠️ Vague |
| Implementation Readiness | 2/10 | ❌ Too ambiguous |
| **OVERALL** | **4/10** | **❌ NO-GO** |

---

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

### ❌ NO-GO - Story Requires Significant Revision

**Recommendation:** Do NOT start implementation. Return to PO for clarification.

---

## REQUIRED FIXES (Blocking)

### Fix #1: Resolve Circular Dependency with Story 6.1

**Action:** Choose ONE:

**Option A (Recommended):** Move business user guide into Story 6.1 as an additional acceptance criterion
- Story 6.1 AC6: "Include business-facing documentation in Epic 6 guide explaining the new rules"
- Story 6.6 focuses on: Advanced documentation, monitoring procedures, rollout communication

**Option B:** Make Story 6.6 occur BEFORE Story 6.1
- Story sequence becomes: 6.2 → 6.3 → 6.4 → 6.6 → 6.1
- Story 6.1 waits for documentation to be available
- Logical flow: Build features (6.2-6.4) → Document (6.6) → Use in rules (6.1)

**Option C:** Split Story 6.6 into two stories
- Story 6.6a (depends on nothing): "Create business user rule guide" (for Story 6.1 to reference)
- Story 6.6b (depends on 6.1): "Create advanced operator procedures" (monitoring, rollout communication)

**Status:** REQUIRES PO DECISION

---

### Fix #2: Specify Exact Locations of All Deliverables

**Action:** For each of 9 ACs, specify:
- Exact file path or location
- Whether it's new file or update to existing file
- What section/heading

**Example:**
```
AC1: Business User Guide
Location: docs/rules/business-user-guide.md (NEW FILE)
Or: docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md § Business User Rule Management Guide (EXPAND)

AC2: Operator Checklist
Location: docs/rules/rule-change-checklist.md (NEW FILE)

AC3: Slack Template Docs
Location: docs/testing/slack-integration.md (ADD NEW SECTION: "Slack Template Management")
```

**Status:** REQUIRES CLARIFICATION

---

### Fix #3: Reduce Acceptance Criteria from 9 to 3-4

**Action:** Group related ACs into single criteria:

**Proposed Restructuring:**
- AC1: "Business user guide covering rule anatomy, conditions, actions, Slack templates, enable/disable, and testing"
- AC2: "Operator checklist covering pre-change, change, post-change steps including monitoring and rollback"
- AC3: "Communication and feedback process documented with stakeholders, channels, and collection mechanism"
- AC4: "Documentation verified with dry-run testing and incorporated into release notes"

**Status:** REQUIRES SIMPLIFICATION

---

### Fix #4: Add Concrete Examples or Templates

**Action:** Provide templates for:
- Example "business user guide" section
- Example operator checklist item
- Example communication plan template

**Status:** REQUIRES EXAMPLES

---

### Fix #5: Specify Testing Procedure

**Action:** Define exact procedure:
- Who runs tests? (Developer or QA?)
- What environment? (local/staging/CI?)
- What commands? (specific pytest commands)
- What tools? (specific linting tool names)
- Success criteria? (exit code 0? No errors?)
- Sign-off? (who reviews? how is it approved?)

**Status:** REQUIRES SPECIFICATION

---

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. PRIMARY: Resolve Circular Dependency First

**This is the blocker.** Story 6.6 cannot proceed until the dependency conflict with Story 6.1 AC5 is resolved.

**Recommendation:** Option B (reorder) or Option C (split story)

---

### 2. SECONDARY: Simplify Acceptance Criteria

**Current:** 9 ACs (too many, too vague)
**Recommended:** 3-4 ACs (clearer success criteria)

---

### 3. TERTIARY: Add Concrete Examples

**Provide templates** for developer to follow:
- Show example business user guide section
- Show example operator checklist
- Show example communication plan

---

### 4. Add Stakeholder Coordination

**Action:** Before implementation, identify:
- Who are "stakeholders" mentioned in AC7?
- What channels will be used? (specific Slack channel? mailing list?)
- What cadence for feedback? (weekly? per-deployment?)
- Who owns monitoring/rollback decisions?

---

---

## VALIDATION SUMMARY

| Category | Finding |
|----------|---------|
| Template Compliance | ✅ All sections present, proper format |
| Acceptance Criteria | ❌ 9 criteria, most ambiguous and underspecified |
| Technical Specifications | ❌ Incomplete, missing concrete examples |
| Dependencies | ❌ CRITICAL: Circular dependency with Story 6.1 AC5 |
| File Paths | ⚠️ Some ambiguity on exact locations |
| Testing | ⚠️ Vague testing procedure |
| Implementation Readiness | ❌ Developer cannot confidently begin |

---

## FINAL VERDICT

### ❌ NO-GO - DO NOT IMPLEMENT

**Status:** Return to PO for revision

**Timeline to Fix:** 1-2 hours for PO to clarify and revise

**Issues to Fix:**
1. ❌ Resolve circular dependency with Story 6.1 (critical blocker)
2. ❌ Clarify exact file locations and deliverable formats
3. ❌ Reduce ACs from 9 to 3-4 with clearer definitions
4. ❌ Add concrete examples and templates
5. ⚠️ Specify testing procedure and stakeholders

**Implementation Readiness Score:** 5/10 → Needs revision
