# VALIDATION REPORT: Story 6.1 - Implement Example Rules from Requirements

**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Story:** 6.1  
**Status:** DRAFT (Pre-Implementation)  
**Validator:** Sarah (Product Owner)  
**Validation Level:** COMPREHENSIVE

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**VALIDATION RESULT: ⚠️ CONDITIONAL GO - Ready with Caveats**

Story 6.1 is **IMPLEMENTATION-READY** with clear acceptance criteria and well-sourced requirements. However, **critical external dependencies (Stories 6.2, 6.3, 6.4) must complete first** before this story can begin. The story itself is well-crafted, but AC5 creates an **upstream dependency on Story 6.6 documentation work**.

**Implementation Readiness Score: 8/10**  
**Confidence Level: HIGH (for story design) / BLOCKED (by dependencies)**

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA VALIDATION

### AC1: Expert Correction Slack Digest Rule ✅ VERIFIED

**Requirement:** `config/rules.yaml` defines rule with `has_option_keyword` filter and `send_slack` action

**Specification Level:** HIGH
- ✅ Exact keyword specified: `["전문가 보정"]`
- ✅ Action specified: `send_slack` with explicit channel and message
- ✅ Template reference: `expert_correction_digest` from `config/slack_templates.yaml`
- ✅ Output format: "name, masked phone number, pro_edit_count in parentheses"

- ✅ Sources: Rule engine tests documentation cited

**Verification:** Clear test strategy

**Status:** ✅ FULL COVERAGE

---

### AC5: Business-Facing Documentation ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE

**Requirement:** "Business-facing documentation in `docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide` explains how to enable, tune, or disable the example rules..."

**Issue:** CIRCULAR DEPENDENCY WITH STORY 6.6
- Story 6.1 **REQUIRES** this documentation to complete AC5
- Story 6.6 **PRODUCES** this documentation
- Story 6.6 **CANNOT START** until Story 6.1 completes
- **This is a deadlock**

**Current Epic 6 Section:**
The section exists but is skeletal (~15 lines) and does NOT contain:
- Detailed operator guidance
- Enable/disable procedures
- Parameter tuning instructions
- Testing validation steps

**Impact:** CRITICAL - AC5 cannot be satisfied until Story 6.6 completes

**Resolution Options:**
1. **Option A (Recommended):** Move AC5 to Story 6.6
   - Story 6.1 AC5 removed
   - Story 6.1 focuses on: Rules implementation + tests
   - Story 6.6 focuses on: All documentation including AC5 requirements

2. **Option B:** Split AC5 into two parts
   - Story 6.1 AC5a: "Basic enable/disable instructions in rule comments"
   - Story 6.6 AC?: "Comprehensive business-facing guide with AC5 requirements"

3. **Option C:** Reorder stories (6.6 before 6.1)
   - Story 6.6 creates documentation
   - Story 6.1 references completed documentation
   - Logical dependency resolved

**Current Status:** ❌ BLOCKS STORY COMPLETION

---

## FILE STRUCTURE AND SOURCE TREE VALIDATION

### ✅ All File Paths Clearly Specified

| File | Purpose | Exists | Status |
|------|---------|--------|--------|
| `config/rules.yaml` | Main rules configuration | ✅ | Ready for new rules |
| `config/slack_templates.yaml` | Slack message templates | ⚠️ | Created by Story 6.2 |
| `tests/integration/test_slack_integration.py` | Slack integration tests | ✅ | Exists, ready to extend |
| `tests/integration/test_rules_regression.py` | Regression tests | ✅ | Exists, ready to extend |
| `tests/fixtures/` | Test fixtures | ✅ | Exists, ready for new scenarios |
| `docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md` | Business guide location | ✅ | Exists but needs expansion |

### ✅ Dev Notes Include Relevant Context

- **Story Dependencies:** Stories 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 explicitly listed
- **Configuration Locations:** Clear guidance to update configs, not engine code
- **Template Handling:** Multiline scalar formatting specified
- **Rule Context:** Fixture field mapping (option_keywords, pro_edit_count) documented
- **Slack Messaging:** PII masking and channel flags specified
- **Regression Harness:** Extend existing suites (not bespoke scripts)

### ✅ Task-to-AC Mapping Is Clear

| Task | ACs Covered | Scope |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Task 1: Finalize Slack digest | AC 1, 2 | Template payload creation |
| Task 2: Encode new rules | AC 1, 3 | Rules.yaml implementation |
| Task 3: Strengthen coverage | AC 2, 4 | Integration tests |
| Task 4: Publish operator guidance | AC 5 | Documentation (⚠️ BLOCKED) |

---

## CRITICAL BLOCKERS

### ❌ BLOCKER 1: Circular Dependency with Story 6.6 (AC5)

**Severity:** CRITICAL - Prevents story completion

**Issue:** Story 6.1 AC5 requires documentation that Story 6.6 produces, but Story 6.6 cannot start until Story 6.1 completes.

**Resolution Required:** See AC5 section above - must choose one of three options

**Timeline Impact:** Cannot proceed with current sequencing

---

### ❌ BLOCKER 2: Upstream Dependencies (Stories 6.2, 6.3, 6.4) Not Complete

**Severity:** CRITICAL - Prevents story from starting

**Issue:** Story 6.1 explicitly depends on:
- Story 6.2: Slack integration (send_slack action)
- Story 6.3: date_range evaluator
- Story 6.4: has_multiple_options evaluator

**Current Status:** All three stories are drafts and not yet implemented

**Timeline Impact:** Cannot start Story 6.1 until Stories 6.2-6.4 complete

**Risk:** If dependencies delay, Story 6.1 will be blocked indefinitely

---

## ANTI-HALLUCINATION VERIFICATION

### ✅ All Technical Claims Verified

| Claim | Source | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Rule engine in config/rules.yaml | src/config/rules.schema.json (exists) | ✅ Verified |
| Slack integration (Story 6.2) | docs/testing/slack-integration.md (exists) | ✅ Verified |
| date_range evaluator (Story 6.3) | docs/stories/6.3.add-date-range-condition-evaluator.md (exists) | ✅ Verified |
| has_multiple_options (Story 6.4) | docs/stories/6.4.add-multi-option-condition-evaluator.md (exists) | ✅ Verified |
| Booking.pro_edit_count field | src/domain/booking.py (exists at line 44) | ✅ Verified |
| Slack template rendering | docs/testing/slack-integration.md (Jinja2 templates section) | ✅ Verified |
| Test patterns | tests/integration/test_rules_regression.py (exists, pattern established) | ✅ Verified |

### ✅ No Invented Requirements

All acceptance criteria are traced to:
- Epic 6 requirements (verified)
- Korean requirements translation (verified in Epic 6)
- Existing documentation (verified)
- Established patterns (test organization, rule engine patterns verified)

---

## TESTING COVERAGE

### ✅ Test Strategy Is Comprehensive

**Unit/Integration Tests:**
- ✅ Expert correction Slack digest payload rendering
- ✅ Holiday event customer list rule execution
- ✅ Regression: new rules don't affect existing rules
- ✅ Coverage goal: ≥80% (established pattern from Story 3.5)

**Test Commands Provided:**
```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_slack_integration.py -k "expert_correction_digest" -v
pytest tests/integration/test_rules_regression.py -k "holiday_event" -v
pytest tests -m integration --cov=src/rules --cov-report=term-missing
```

**Assessment:** ✅ SPECIFIC AND EXECUTABLE

### ✅ Test Scenarios Identified

For "Expert Correction Slack Digest":
- ✅ Happy path: booking with "전문가 보정" keyword triggers Slack message
- ✅ Masking: phone number masked correctly
- ✅ Count: pro_edit_count rendered in parentheses
- ✅ Format: Multiline formatting preserved

For "Holiday Event Customer List":
- ✅ Happy path: booking within date_range with 2+ keywords triggers message
- ✅ Threshold: exactly 2 keywords matches (boundary test)
- ✅ Before range: booking before start_date doesn't trigger
- ✅ After range: booking after end_date doesn't trigger
- ✅ Insufficient options: booking with 1 keyword doesn't trigger

**Assessment:** ✅ GOOD COVERAGE

## SHOULD-FIX ISSUES (Important Quality Improvements)

### ⚠️ ISSUE 1: AC2 Requires Operations Approval (Low Priority)

**Severity:** LOW - Can be resolved during implementation

**Issue:** AC2 requires "operations-approved Korean wording" for Slack digest

**Current State:** No specific wording provided; developer must draft

**Recommendation:** Add to Dev Notes:
```
AC2 Note: Korean wording for expert_correction_digest template must be approved by operations team.
Suggested template structure:
{{today_date}} 전문가 보정 선택 고객 리스트:
{% for booking in bookings %}
- {{booking.name}} ({{booking.phone_masked}}) - {{booking.pro_edit_count}}건
{% endfor %}
```

**Impact:** Minimal - Developer can draft and get async approval

**Status:** ⚠️ RECOMMEND ADDING TEMPLATE EXAMPLE

---

### ⚠️ ISSUE 2: No Example YAML Rules Shown

**Severity:** LOW - Can reference Epic 6

**Issue:** Story doesn't show exact YAML for the two rules

**Current State:** Story references rules but doesn't show YAML syntax

**Recommendation:** Add to Dev Notes:
```yaml
# Expert Correction Slack Digest
- name: "Expert Correction Slack Digest"
  enabled: true
  conditions:
    - type: "has_option_keyword"
      params:
        keywords: ["전문가 보정"]
  actions:
    - type: "send_slack"
      params:
        channel: "#operations"
        template_name: "expert_correction_digest"

# Holiday Event Customer List
- name: "Holiday Event Customer List"
  enabled: true
  conditions:
    - type: "date_range"
      params:
        start_date: "2025-12-20"
        end_date: "2025-12-31"
    - type: "has_multiple_options"
      params:
        keywords: ["원본", "네이버"]
        min_count: 2
  actions:
    - type: "send_slack"
      params:
        channel: "#marketing"
        message: "Holiday booking: {{booking.name}} - {{booking.phone}} - {{booking.store_id}}"
```

**Impact:** Minimal - Already in Epic 6; developer can reference

**Status:** ⚠️ NICE-TO-HAVE (EXAMPLE WOULD HELP)

---

### ⚠️ ISSUE 3: Task 4 Depends on Story 6.6 (Cannot Complete Alone)

**Severity:** MEDIUM - Clarifies dependency

**Issue:** Task 4 asks to "Document rule parameters, digest template names, and Slack channel expectations in `docs/epics/epic-6-post-mvp-enhancements.md#business-user-rule-management-guide`"

**Problem:** Developer cannot complete this task alone because:
1. The business-user-rule-management-guide section is minimal (15 lines)
2. Expanding it requires Story 6.6 work (which is blocked on Story 6.1)
3. Circular dependency

**Recommendation:** Clarify Task 4:
- Option A: Move to Story 6.6
- Option B: Task 4 limited to "Add rule comments and metadata only, full documentation in Story 6.6"
- Option C: Task 4 expanded: "Create comprehensive business-user guide (Story 6.6 scope)"

**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS CLARIFICATION

---

## DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS

### ✅ Upstream Dependencies Documented

Story correctly identifies:
- Depends on Stories 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
- Cannot begin until those stories complete
- Correct sequence in Epic 6

### ✅ Downstream Dependency Identified

Story 6.1 identified as prerequisite for:
- Story 6.5 (performance optimization) - indirect (needs stable rules)
- But NOT explicitly Story 6.6

### ❌ Circular Dependency with Story 6.6 Not Addressed

**Issue:** AC5 creates upstream dependency on Story 6.6, but sequencing shows 6.6 depending on 6.1

**Current Sequencing (Epic 6):**
1. Story 6.2 (Slack)
2. Story 6.3 (Date Range)
3. Story 6.4 (Multi-Option)
4. Story 6.1 (Example Rules) ← BLOCKED: needs 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
5. Story 6.6 (Documentation) ← BLOCKED: needs 6.1 AC5 complete

**Problem:** 6.1 AC5 requires documentation that 6.6 produces

**Must Be Resolved Before:** Story 6.1 can be marked ready

## VALIDATION SCORECARD

| Dimension | Score | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Template Compliance | 10/10 | ✅ |
| Acceptance Criteria Clarity | 8/10 | ⚠️ AC5 blocked by 6.6 |
| Task Completeness | 8/10 | ⚠️ Task 4 depends on 6.6 |
| Source Verification | 10/10 | ✅ |
| Dependency Analysis | 6/10 | ⚠️ Circular dependency not identified |
| Testing Specification | 9/10 | ✅ |
| Implementation Design | 9/10 | ✅ |
| **OVERALL** | **8/10** | **✅ READY (with caveats)** |

---

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

### ✅ GO - Story Is Well-Designed (with caveats)

**Recommendation:** APPROVE FOR IMPLEMENTATION (when dependencies ready)

**Important Notes:**
1. ✅ Story design is excellent - clear requirements, good sourcing, comprehensive tests
2. ⚠️ **BLOCKED ON UPSTREAM DEPENDENCIES:** Cannot start until Stories 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 complete
3. ❌ **AC5 MUST BE RESOLVED:** Circular dependency with Story 6.6 must be addressed before marking story ready

---

## REQUIRED ACTIONS BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION

### Action 1 (CRITICAL): Resolve AC5 Circular Dependency

**Choose ONE:**

**Option A (Recommended):** Move AC5 to Story 6.6
- Story 6.1 focuses on: Rules implementation + tests (AC 1-4)
- Story 6.6 focuses on: All documentation (AC 1 in 6.6)
- Breaks circular dependency
- Better separation of concerns

**Option B:** Make AC5 Optional or Minimal
- Story 6.1 AC5: "Add inline rule comments explaining enable/disable"
- Story 6.6 AC?: "Comprehensive business-facing guide"
- Still requires Story 6.6 to do real documentation work

**Option C:** Reorder Stories
- Do Story 6.6 first (doesn't depend on 6.1 implementation)
- Then Story 6.1 (references completed 6.6 documentation)
- Reverses current sequence

**Status:** REQUIRES PO DECISION

---

### Action 2 (CRITICAL): Wait for Stories 6.2, 6.3, 6.4

**Prerequisites:**
- Story 6.2: Slack integration must be implemented and tested
- Story 6.3: date_range evaluator must be implemented and registered
- Story 6.4: has_multiple_options evaluator must be implemented and registered

**Verification:** All three stories must reach "Done" status

**Estimated Timeline:** Based on effort estimates:
- Story 6.2: ~1.5 days
- Story 6.3: ~0.5 days
- Story 6.4: ~0.5 days
- **Total: ~2.5 days before Story 6.1 can start**

---

### Action 3 (MINOR): Get Operations Approval for Slack Wording

**Required For:** AC2 completion

**Action:** Engage operations team to provide/approve Korean wording for "expert_correction_digest" template

**Timing:** Can be done during Story 6.2 implementation or as Story 6.1 ramp-up

---

## IMPLEMENTATION READINESS

### ✅ Developer Can Implement (when dependencies ready)

**Story Provides:**
- ✅ Exact configuration requirements
- ✅ Specific file paths and locations
- ✅ Clear test scenarios and expected outcomes
- ✅ Integration points with other stories
- ✅ All necessary technical context in Dev Notes

**Developer Will NOT Need:**
- ✅ External reference to architecture docs (context provided)
- ✅ Guessing at requirements (all explicit)
- ✅ Inventing test scenarios (all specified)

### ⚠️ Dependencies Block Immediate Start

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Stories 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 (2.5 days estimated)
- Week 1-2: Story 6.1 (1 day, blocked until 6.2-6.4 done)
- Week 2: Story 6.6 (0.5 days, depends on 6.1 AC5 resolution)

---
